Previous reports have shown the effectiveness of BP in treating cancer diseases. However, BP has no targeting capacity towards specific cancer cells. To improve treatment efficiency and reduce the dose of BP used in cancer treatment, targeting-based approaches should be developed. In the present study, we used riboflavin-5′-phosphate (RFMP) immobilized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe 3 O 4 MNPs) as carriers for BP to treat cancer cell lines derived from liver, prostate and breast. These model cancer cells overexpress riboflavin receptors on their cell membrane and are also sensitive to BP treatment. Thus, BP-binding free RFMP on MNPs can be used as probes to target these model cells, whereas BP can be readily released on target cancer cells. Cell viability was twofold lower by using Fe 3 O 4 @RFMP MNPs immobilized with BP than that achieved by using free-form BP at a similar amount. Moreover, BP-Fe 3 O 4 @RFMP MNPs have no apparent harmful effects on non-target cells. In addition, we evaluated the level of cysteine-aspartic acid protease 3 (caspase 3) in the resultant cell lysate obtained after treatment by BP-Fe 3 O 4 @RFMP MNPs to demonstrate that apoptosis is mainly involved in the growth inhibition of target cells. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

The replacement of hazardous halogenated solvents is a priority in the commercialization of solution-processed OSCs.

Through the combination of morphological manipulation of active layer and interfacial engineering, the resulting OSCs deliver a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 11.09%. Importantly, large-area (216 cm2) blade-coated bulk-heterojunction OSCs is also demonstrated, and the resulting devices deliver a high PCE up to 5.03%, which is comparable to those of the devices processed with halogenated solvents (PCE = 5.20%). Additionally, the devices processed with halogen-free solvents also exhibit superior stability, maintaining 88% of its initial efficiency after 3960 h of continuous operation. More encouragingly, halogen-free solvents-based manufacturing process can also be performed under ambient conditions, and a moderate PCE of 3.67% is attained for large-area (216 cm2) OSCs. To the best of our knowledge, 3.67% represents the highest efficiency ever reported for air-processed large-area OSCs. This work paves the way towards the realization of environmentally-friendly large-area OSCs with high performance and long-term stability. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Air-processing; Blade-coating; Halogen-free solvent; Large area; Organic solar cells,Butyric acid; Carboxylation; Coatings; Efficiency; Halogenation; Heterojunctions; Organic solvents; Air processing; Blade coatings; Halogen-free; Large area; Manufacturing process; Morphological manipulations; N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone; Power conversion efficiencies; Organic solar cells,2-s2.0-85071398493

In nucleic acid detection, GC-rich nucleic acid sequences form self- and cross-dimers and stem-loop structures, which can easily obtain data containing signals from nonspecific DNA binding. The features of GC-rich nucleic acid sequences cause inaccuracies in nucleic acid detection and hinder the development of precision medicine. To improve the inaccurate detection results, we used phosphate-methylated (neutral) nucleotides to synthesize the neutralized chimeric DNA oligomer probe. The probe fragment originated from a primer for the detection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 3b, and single-mismatched and perfect-matched targets were designed for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) detection on the SiNW FET device. Experimental results revealed that the HCV-3b chimeric neutralized DNA (nDNA) probe exhibited better performance for SNP discrimination in 10 mM bis-tris propane buffer at 25 °C than a regular DNA probe. The SNP discrimination of the nDNA probe could be further improved at 40 °C on the FET device. Consequently, the neutralized chimeric DNA probe could successfully distinguish SNP in the detection of GC-rich target sequences under optimal operating conditions on the SiNW FET device. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85069933910

The dysbiotic features of the transition from advanced polyp to early-stage CRC are largely unknown. We performed a 16S rRNA gene sequencing and enterotype-based gut microbiota analysis study. In addition to Bacteroides- and Prevotella-dominated enterotypes, we identified an Escherichia-dominated enterotype. We found that the dysbiotic features of CRC were dissimilar in overall samples and especially Escherichia-dominated enterotype. Besides a higher abundance of Fusobacterium, Enterococcus, and Aeromonas in all CRC faecal microbiota, we found that the most notable characteristic of CRC faecal microbiota was a decreased abundance of potential beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria. Notably, Oscillospira was depleted in the transition from advanced adenoma to stage 0 CRC, whereas Haemophilus was depleted in the transition from stage 0 to early-stage CRC. We further identified 7 different CAGs by analysing bacterial clusters. The abundance of microbiota in cluster 3 significantly increased in the CRC group, whereas that of cluster 5 decreased. The abundance of both cluster 5 and cluster 7 decreased in the Escherichia-dominated enterotype of the CRC group. We present the first enterotype-based faecal microbiota analysis. The gut microbiota of colorectal neoplasms can be influenced by its enterotype. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85069903330

However, the analysis of MP-interacting proteins and downstream pathways across human malignancies remains challenging. Here, we present a systematically integrated method to generate a resource of cancer membrane protein-regulated networks (CaMPNets), containing 63,746 high-confidence protein–protein interactions (PPIs) for 1962 MPs, using expression profiles from 5922 tumors with overall survival outcomes across 15 human cancers. Comprehensive analysis of CaMPNets links MP partner communities and regulated pathways to provide MP-based gene sets for identifying prognostic biomarkers and druggable targets. For example, we identify CHRNA9 with 12 PPIs (e.g., ERBB2) can be a therapeutic target and find its anti-metastasis agent, bupropion, for treatment in nicotine-induced breast cancer.

Materials and Methods: CNVs in 37 OSCC tissue specimens were analyzed using a high-resolution microarray, the OncoScan array. Gene expression was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 127 OSCC and normal tissue samples. Cell function assays included cell cycle, migration, invasion and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Results: We found a novel copy number amplified region, chromosome 9p, encompassing MLLT3 via the comparison of our data set with six other OSCC genome-wide CNV data sets. MLLT3 overexpression was associated with poorer overall survival in patients with OSCC (p =.048). MLLT3 knockdown reduced cell migration and invasion. The reduced invasion ability in MLLT3-knockdown cells was rescued with double knockdown of MLLT3 and CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with ED rich carboxy-terminal domain 4 (CITED4; 21.0% vs. 61.5%). Knockdown of MLLT3 impaired disruptor of telomeric silencing-1-like (Dot1L)-associated hypermethylation in the promoter of the tumor suppressor, CITED4 (p <.001), and hence dysregulated HIF-1α-mediated genes (TWIST, MMP1, MMP2, VIM, and CDH1) in OSCC cells. Conclusion: We identified unique CNVs in tumors of Taiwanese patients with OSCC. Notably, MLLT3 overexpression is related to the poorer prognosis of patients with OSCC and is required for Dot1L-mediated transcriptional repression of CITED4, leading to dysregulation of HIF-1α-mediated genes. Implications for Practice: This article reports unique copy number variations in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tumors of Taiwanese patients. Notably, MLLT3 overexpression is related to the poorer prognosis of patients with OSCC and is required for Dot1L-mediated transcriptional repression of CITED4, leading to dysregulation of HIF-1α-mediated genes. ?

The N, S-GQDs and Au-PANI were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal pyrolysis and interfacial polymerization, respectively. Subsequently, 2–9 nm N, S-GQDs are successfully decorated onto 30–50 nm Au-PANI nanowires by Au-thiol linkage to serve as the bifunctional probe for amplifying the electrochemical activity as well as anchoring anti-CEA. The N, S-GQDs@Au-PANI nanowires are excellent conducting materials to accelerate the electron transfer, while the formation of CEA antibody-antigen bioconjugates after the addition of CEA significantly increase the charge transfer resistance, and subsequently provides a highly stable and label-free immunoassay platform for the impedimetric detection of CEA. The label-free immunosensor exhibits a wide linear range from 0.5 to 1000 ng mL ?1 with a low detection limit of 0.01 ng mL ?1 . The N, S-GQDs@Au-PANI based immunosensor also shows high selectivity and stability over other cancer makers and amino acids.

A counterbalance between WNT and BMP-2 and the subsequent two-step mechanism are identified through molecular and genetic analyses. Macrophages are first recruited by chemokines produced by stretch and polarized to M2 phenotype. Growth factors such as HGF and IGF-1, released by M2 macrophages, then activate stem cells and facilitate hair regeneration.

The authors use a Markov chain model and PageRank-like algorithm to construct a novel algorithm called EpiRank to measure infection risk in a spatially confined commuting network on Taiwan island. Data from the country’s 2000 census were used to map epidemic risk distribution as a commuting network function. A daytime parameter was used to integrate forward and backward movement in order to analyze daily commuting patterns. EpiRank algorithm results were tested by comparing calculations with actual disease distributions for the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak and enterovirus cases between 2000 and 2008. Results suggest that the bidirectional movement model outperformed models that considered forward or backward direction only in terms of capturing spatial epidemic risk distribution. EpiRank also outperformed models based on network indexes such as PageRank and HITS. According to a sensitivity analysis of the daytime parameter, the backward movement effect is more important than the forward movement effect for understanding a commuting network’s disease diffusion structure. Our evidence supports the use of EpiRank as an alternative network measure for analyzing disease diffusion in a commuting network. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85063723473

Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been using as prognostic biomarkers for therapeutics and interventions in various cancers. Considering the poor survival of NB, the lncRNA-based therapeutic strategies must be improved. This work proposes an overall survival time estimator called SVR-NB to identify the lncRNA signature that is associated with the overall survival of patients with NB. SVR-NB is an optimized support vector regression (SVR)-based method that uses an inheritable bi-objective combinatorial genetic algorithm for feature selection. The dataset of 231 NB patients that contains overall survival information and expression profiles of 783 lncRNAs was used to design and evaluate SVR-NB from the database of gene expression omnibus accession GSE62564. SVR-NB identified a signature of 35 lncRNAs and achieved a mean squared correlation coefficient of 0.85 and a mean absolute error of 0.56 year between the actual and estimated overall survival time using 10-fold cross-validation. Further, we ranked and characterized the 35 lncRNAs according to their contribution towards the estimation accuracy.

To address this, we developed TACCO (Transcriptome Alterations in CanCer Omnibus), a database for identifying differentially expressed genes and altered pathways in cancer. TACCO also reveals miRNA cooperative regulations and supports construction of models for prognosis. The resulting signatures have great potential for patient stratification and treatment decision-making in future clinical applications.

The efficacy of current treatment or preventive strategies for such inflammation is still inadequate. Thus, new anti-inflammatory strategies are needed. In this study, based on molecular docking and structural analysis, a potential peptide KCF18 with amphiphilic properties (positively charged and hydrophobic residues) derived from the receptors of proinflammatory cytokines was designed to inhibit cytokine-induced inflammatory response. Simulations suggested that KCF18 could bind to cytokines simultaneously, and electrostatic interactions were dominant. Surface plasmon resonance detection showed that KCF18 bound to both tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6, which is consistent with MM/PBSA binding free energy calculations. The cell experiments showed that KCF18 significantly reduced the binding of proinflammatory cytokines to their cognate receptors, suppressed TNF-α mRNA expression and monocyte binding and transmigration, and alleviated the infiltration of white blood cells in a peritonitis mouse model. The designed peptide KCF18 could remarkably diminish the risk of vascular inflammation by decreasing plasma cytokines release and by directly acting on the vascular endothelium. This study demonstrated that a combination of structure-based in silico design calculations, together with experimental measurements can be used to develop potential anti-inflammatory agents. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85061839746

The dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) has been implicated in the vascular leakage that characterizes severe dengue virus infection, however, the molecular mechanisms involved are not known. Methods: A cohort of 250 dengue patients has been followed from the onset of symptoms to the recovery phase. Serum hyaluronan levels and several other clinical parameters were recorded. The effect of NS1 treatment of cultured fibroblasts and endothelial cells on the expressions of hyaluronan synthetic and catabolic enzymes and the hyaluronan receptor CD44, were determined, as have the effects on the formation of hyaluronan-rich matrices and endothelial permeability. Findings: Elevated serum hyaluronan levels (?70 ng/ml) during early infection was found to be an independent predictor for occurrence of warning signs, and thus severe dengue fever. High circulating levels of the viral protein NS1, indicative of disease severity, correlated with high concentrations of serum hyaluronan. NS1 exposure decreased the expression of CD44 in differentiating endothelial cells impairing the integrity of vessel-like structures, and promoted the synthesis of hyaluronan in dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells in synergy with dengue-induced pro-inflammatory mediators. Deposited hyaluronan-rich matrices around cells cultured in vitro recruited CD44-expressing macrophage-like cells, suggesting a mechanism for enhancement of inflammation. In cultured endothelial cells, perturbed hyaluronan-CD44 interactions enhanced endothelial permeability through modulation of VE-cadherin and cytoskeleton re-organization, and exacerbated the NS1-induced disruption of endothelial integrity. Interpretation: Pharmacological targeting of hyaluronan biosynthesis and/or its CD44-mediated signaling may limit the life-threatening vascular leakiness during moderate-to-severe dengue virus infection.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the holding position, shapes, bend angles of the endotracheal tube (ET) and the stylet-assisted lifting of the epiglottis could improve the success rate of intubation. Methods: Thirty-two participants, 26 physicians, 2 residents, and 4 nurse practitioners, with 12.09 ± 5.38 years of work experience in the emergency department and more than 150 annual intubation events, were enrolled in this randomized, cross-over mannequin study. We investigated the effects of straight-to-cuff ET shapes with 35° and 50° bend angles, banana-shaped ET with longitudinal distances of 28 cm and 26 cm, two methods of holding the ET (either on the top or in the middle), and lifting or not the epiglottis, on the intubation duration, its success rate, and its subjective difficulty. The aim of the study is to provide optimized intubation strategies for difficult airway with C-L IIb or III grades, when the inlet of the trachea cannot be visualized. Results: The two groups that lifted the epiglottis using the stylets, in bend angles of 35° and 50°, had the shortest duration of intubation (23.75 ± 14.24 s and 20.72 ± 6.90 s, hazard ratios 1.54 and 1.85 with 95% confidence intervals [95% CI] of 1.01-2.34 and 1.23-2.78, respectively) and a 100% success rate in intubations. In the survival analysis, lifting of the epiglottis was the only significant factor (p < 0.0001, 95% CI 1.34-2.11) associated with the success rate of intubation. Conclusions: The use of the epiglottic lift as an adjunctive technique can facilitate the intubation and improve its success rate without increasing procedure difficulty, in C-L III airway, when only the epiglottis is seen.

The calibration of the mass spectrometer has been done by using different sizes of polystyrene (PS) particles (2-15 μm). The measured masses of RBCs were around 1.8 × 1013 Da and MCF-7 cancer cells were between 1 × 1014 and 4 × 1014 Da.

Generally, chemotherapy is the main treatment for cancer, but it may kill both cancerous cells as well as normal cells that cause serious side effects in the patient due to lack of specific targeting for cancerous cells. In order to achieve better efficiency in the cancer treatment, the development of targeted drug delivery platform has been a goal for a long time. Herein, we constructed folic acid decorated azide functionalized biocompatible mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) to target tumor cells through folate receptor (FR), a widely expressed receptor in cancer cells. In colon and ovarian cancer cells, high endogenous H2S levels are found. They can be used as a trigger for the azide reduction, which leads to the cleavage of ester linkage and results in DOX release from MSNP nanocarriers. Additionally, confocal cell images of HCT-116, HT-29, A2780, SKOV3, and HeLa cells treated with nanoparticles revealed an effective internalization of MSNPs in these cells. Interestingly, DOX-loaded MSNP-N3-FA-treated HT-29 cells showed a significant decrease in the cell viability, whereas, there was no substantial change in HeLa cells. We also demonstrated that DOX-loaded MSNP-N3-FA has superior in vivo chemotherapy efficacy compared to free DOX. These observations indicated that the designed nanocarriers on MSNP-N3-FA specifically respond in the presence of H2S. MSNP-N3-FA is the first potential nanocarrier for endogenous H2S-based efficient DOX release for colon and ovarian cancers.

Different from the Kanzius device, modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT) utilizes the capacitive-impedance coupled 13.56 MHz radiofrequency (RF) current and has been approved for clinical cancer treatment. In this study, we investigated the heating characteristics of spherical-, urchin-, and rod-like AuNPs of a similar 50 nm size upon exposure to a 13.56 MHz radiofrequency using the LabEHY-105CL, an in vivo mEHT device. We found that, regardless of the AuNPs' sphere-, urchin- or rod-like shape, purified gold nanoparticle solution would not promote heat generation. The temperature elevation during radiofrequency irradiation was solely attributed to the ionic background of the solution. The AuNPs present in the medium (?25 ppm) showed no effect on selective cell killing of malignant cells, whereas the AuNPs incorporated in the cells diminished the cell selectivity as well as cell death and acted as protectors in mEHT cancer treatment. Our study suggested that (1) the temperature elevation induced by 50 nm AuNPs in the 13.56 MHz radiofrequency field was negligible and was shape-independent, and (2) the presence of AuNPs would alter the cell-killing effect of modulated electro-hyperthermia. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.",modulated electro-hyperthermia; radiofrequency; rod-like gold nanoparticle; sphere-like gold nanoparticle; urchin-like gold nanoparticle,Cell death; Diseases; Hyperthermia therapy; Metal nanoparticles; Spheres; Cell-selectivity; Malignant cells; modulated electro-hyperthermia; Radio frequencies; Radio-frequency fields; Radiofrequency irradiation; Temperature elevation; Urchin-like; Gold nanoparticles,2-s2.0-85070542949

Static or dynamic culture preserve differential potentials to affect human mesenchymal stem cells’ (hMSCs) proliferation and differentiation. In this study, hMSCs were seeded on fiber disks and cultured in a bidirectional-flow bioreactor or spinner-flask bioreactor with a supplement of osteogenic medium. The hMSCs’ proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and extracellular matrix deposition of mineralization were demonstrated. The results showed that the spinner flask improved cell viability at the first two weeks while the bidirectional-flow reactor increased the cell proliferation of hMSCs through the four-week culture period. Despite the flow reactor having a higher cell number, a lower lactose/glucose ratio was noted, revealing that the bidirectional-flow bioreactor provides better oxygen accessibility to the cultured cells/disk construct. The changes of calcium ions in the medium, the depositions of Ca2+ in the cells/disk constructs, and alkaline phosphate/osteocalcin activities showed the static culture of hMSCs caused cells to mineralize faster than the other two bioreactors but without cell proliferation. Otherwise, cells were distributed uniformly with abundant extracellular matrix productions using the flow reactor. This reveals that the static and dynamic cultivations regulated the osteogenic process differently in hMSCs. The bidirectional-flow bioreactor can be used in the mass production and cultivation of hMSCs for applications in bone regenerative medicine. ? 2019 by the authors.

This study hypothesizes that higher greenness exposure benefits glucose control with increased intensity of physical activity. We used data from a longitudinal health examination database in Taiwan during 2000–2014. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used as an objective indicator of greenness in the neighborhood. Fasting plasma glucose served as an indicator of early diabetes diagnosis. A metabolic equivalent value (MET) based on a compendium of physical activities was used to estimate the intensity of physical activity. We applied a linear mixed-effect model with an individual-level random effect to investigate the relationship between neighborhood greenness and the fasting plasma glucose value stratified by four levels of physical activity. There are 341,211 participants with no diabetes, and 773,602 check-up visits included here. The fasting glucose among participants living in areas with higher green space was lower than that of those living in less green areas. The beneficial effects of greenspace on glucose were stronger for those with more physical activity, especially in the 500-m buffer. In the physically inactive group, compared with the lowest quantile (Q1) of cumulative average greenness, people living in the highest quantile (Q4) of greenness had 0.35 mg less glucose in each dl of plasma [95% confidence interval: ?0.50, ?0.20]. In the physically active group, people residing in the highest quantile (Q4) of greenness had 0.48 mg less glucose in each dl of plasma [95% confidence interval: ?0.73, ?0.23]. Higher residential greenness appears to be associated with lower glucose. Higher physical activity can mediate this association.

A very large increase in drug accumulation by active targeting may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of PLD. We established a humanized bispecific antibody (BsAb; mPEG × HER2) which has dual specificity for methoxy-polyethylene glycol (mPEG) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) to enhance the specificity, internalization and anticancer activity of PLD for cancer cells that overexpress HER2. One-step formulation of PLD with mPEG × HER2 converted the PLD into HER2 targeted liposomes that were stable at 4 °C in PBS as well as at 37 °C in the presence of serum. αHER2/PLD induced receptor-mediated endocytosis and enhanced doxorubicin accumulation in MCF7/HER2 (HER2-amplified) breast cancer cells. αHER2/PLD also displayed more than 200-fold increased cytotoxicity to MCF7/HER2 cells and 28-fold increased cytotoxicity to drug-resistant MDA-MB-361 cells with a physical deletion of the TOP2A gene. αHER2/PLD specifically accumulated doxorubicin in the nucleus of cancer cells in tumor-bearing mice and produced significantly greater antitumor activity against MCF7/HER2 (P < 0.0001) and MDA-MB-361 (P < 0.05) tumors as compared to untargeted PLD. Furthermore, the cardiotoxicity of αHER2/PLD was similar to that of PLD in human cardiomyocytes and in mice. Our results indicate that the one-step formulation of PLD by mPEG × HER2 is a simple method to confer tumor specificity, increase drug internalization and enhance the anticancer activity of PLD against HER2-overexpressing and doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Antibodies; Cells; Cytology; Diseases; Liposomes; Mammals; Molecular biology; Tumors; Anti-tumor activities; Anticancer activities; Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2); Liposomal doxorubicin; Methoxypolyethylene glycol; PEGylated nanoparticle; Receptor-mediated endocytosis; Therapeutic efficacy; Targeted drug delivery; bispecific antibody; doxorubicin; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; macrogol derivative; methoxy polyethylene glycol; nanoparticle; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; bispecific antibody; doxorubicin; drug carrier; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; macrogol; monomethoxypolyethylene glycol; nanoparticle; animal experiment; animal model; antibody specificity; antineoplastic activity; Article; breast cancer; cancer cell; cardiotoxicity; comparative study; controlled study; drug accumulation; drug cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug uptake; endocytosis; gene overexpression; human; human cell; in vitro study; live cell imaging; MCF-7 cell line; MDA-MB-361 cell line; mouse; nanomedicine; nonhuman; PEGylation; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; transthoracic echocardiography; tumor volume; animal; breast tumor; cardiac muscle cell; chemistry; drug effect; drug formulation; drug resistance; immunology; metabolism; pathology; transport at the cellular level; Animals; Antibodies, Bispecific; Antineoplastic Agents; Biological Transport; Breast Neoplasms; Doxorubicin; Drug Carriers; Drug Compounding; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Humans; MCF-7 Cells; Mice; Myocytes, Cardiac; Nanoparticles; Polyethylene Glycols; Receptor, ErbB-2",2-s2.0-85069770898

This essay suggests that we see both the rise of luxurious housing and eco-friendly farming as different patches of human-to-land relationships woven together through a landscape structure undergirded by the rise and fall of nuclear-family farms in post–World War II Taiwan. The uniqueness of the eco-friendly farmers in Yilan lies in their abilities to foster new livelihoods through creative assemblages of more-than-human economies and ecologies. By taking care of the wandering ghosts in the paddies, for example, new farmers join old farmers and villagers to enact a more-than-human world where both the material and the formless matter. By taking care of the paddy creatures, new farmers also join the health- and environmentally conscious urban consumers in enacting a more-than-human world where human well-being depends heavily on the well-being of nonhumans.

MIR as a prognostic marker is more accessible when compared with long-term follow-up survival surveys. Theoretically, countries with good health care systems would have favorable outcomes for cancer; however, no report has yet demonstrated an association between gallbladder cancer MIR and the World's Health System ranking. METHODS: We used linear regression to analyze the correlation of MIRs with the World Health Organization (WHO) rankings and total expenditures on health/gross domestic product (e/GDP) in 57 countries selected according to the data quality. RESULTS: The results showed high crude rates of incidence/mortality but low MIR in more developed regions. Among continents, Europe had the highest crude rates of incidence/mortality, whereas the highest age-standardized rates (ASR) of incidence/mortality were in Asia. The MIR was lowest in North America and highest in Africa (0.40 and 1.00, respectively). Furthermore, favorable MIRs were correlated with good WHO rankings and high e/GDP (p?=?0.01 and p?=?0.030, respectively).

The current study used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to investigate the relationship between age, brain variation in white matter (WM) integrity, and cognitive function. Sixteen younger adults (aged 20–28 years) and 18 healthy older adults (aged 60–75 years) underwent DTI scanning and a standardized battery of neuropsychological measures. Behaviorally, older adults exhibited poorer performance on multiple cognitive measures compared to younger adults. At the neural level, the effects of aging on theWM integrity were evident within interhemispheric (the anterior portion of corpus callosum) and transverse (the right uncinate fasciculus) fibers of the frontal regions, and the cingulum-angular fibers. Our correlation results showed that age-related WM differentially influenced cognitive function, with increased fractional anisotropy values in both the anterior corpus callosum and the right cingulum/angular fibers positively correlated with performance on the visuospatial task in older adults. Moreover, mediation analysis further revealed that the WM tract integrity of the frontal interhemspheric fibers was a significant mediator of age–visuospatial performance relation in older adults, but not in younger adults. These findings support the vulnerability of the frontal WM fibers to normal aging and push forward our understanding of cognitive aging by providing a more integrative view of the neural basis of linkages among aging, cognition, and brain. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Brain aging; cognition; diffusion tensor imaging; frontal interhemispheric fibers; visuospatial ability,adult; aged; article; cingulum (brain); clinical article; cognition; cognitive aging; controlled study; diffusion tensor imaging; female; fractional anisotropy; frontal cortex; genu (corpus callosum); human; male; mediator; middle aged; uncinate fasciculus; young adult,2-s2.0-85045138437

A new definition of overwork increased the number of recognised cases. Meanwhile, actual average working hours decreased. We estimated the effects of the revised criteria on the number of overwork-related CCVD cases and the mediation effect through reduced working hours. Methods From the Labor Insurance of Taiwan, we collected data on the total number of overwork-related CCVD cases from 2006 to 2016 and average monthly working hours for 13 industry groups. We conducted causal mediation analysis to investigate the mechanism of the effect of new criteria on CCVD mediated by working hours. Results From 2006 to 2016, 594 overwork-related cases of CCVD were recognised across 13 industry groups. After introducing the new criteria, overwork-related CCVD increased by 8.40 cases (per one million person-years) (95% CI 4.53 to 15.05), which resulted from a decrease of 1.54 (95% CI 0.22 to 3.82) cases due to reduced working hours (mediation effect) and an increase of 9.93 (95% CI 5.24 to 18.17) cases related to the effect of the criteria change and other covariates excluding working hours (alternative effect). Conclusions Working hours are an important mediator of the effect of policy on the rate of overwork-related CCVD. Introducing new criteria for recognising overwork-related disease might raise awareness and prompt reductions in working hours, which also help to reduce CCVD. Our findings suggest that understanding mediation effects is important to evaluating national health policies. ? 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)). Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

The principle of hybridization stands for combining at least two different BCI modalities into a single interface with the aim of improving the information transfer rate by increasing the recognition accuracy and number of choices available for the user. This study proposes a simultaneous hybrid BCI system that recognizes the motor imagery (MI) and the steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) using the EEG signals from a dual-channel EEG setting with sensors placed over the central area (C3 and C4 channels). The data processing implements a supervised optimization algorithm for the feature extraction, named the common frequency pattern, which finds the optimal spectral filter that maximizes the separability of the data by classes. The experiment compares the classification accuracy in a two-class task using the MI, SSVEP and hybrid approaches on seventeen healthy 18-29 years old subjects with various dual-channel setups and complete set of thirty EEG electrodes. The designed system reaches a high accuracy of 97.4 ± 1.1% in the hybrid task using the C3-C4 channel configuration, which is marginally lower than the 98.8 ± 0.5% accuracy achieved with the complete set of channels while applying the support vector classifier; in the plain SSVEP task the accuracy drops from 91.3 ± 3.9% to 86.0 ± 2.5% while moving from the occipital to central area under the dual-channel condition. The results demonstrate that by combining the principles of hybridization and data-driven spectral filtering for the feature selection it is feasible to compensate a lack of spatial information and implement the proposed BCI using a portable few channel EEG device even under sub-optimal conditions for the sensors placement. ? 2001-2011 IEEE.",Brain computer interface; Channel reduction; Common frequency pattern; Electroencephalography; Motor imagery; Steady-state visual evoked potential,Brain; Data handling; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Feature extraction; Information filtering; Interface states; Channel reduction; Frequency patterns; Information transfer rate; Motor imagery; Optimization algorithms; Steady state visual evoked potentials; Steady state visually evoked potentials; Support vector classifiers; Brain computer interface; adult; algorithm; Article; brain computer interface; classification accuracy; clinical article; cognition; common frequency pattern; cross validation; data processing; diagnostic accuracy; electroencephalogram; electrophysiology; endotracheal intubation; event related spectral perturbation; female; Fourier transformation; human; human experiment; imagery; machine learning; male; mathematical analysis; measurement accuracy; motor cortex; normal human; sensitivity and specificity; signal noise ratio; signal processing; visual evoked potential; visual stimulation; young adult,2-s2.0-85068864341

Many AURKA mutations were identified in cancer patients. Overexpressing wild-type Aurka developed a low incidence of hepatic tumors after long latency in mice. However, none of the AURKA mutant animal models have ever been described. The mechanism of mutant AURKA-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis is still unclear. A novel AURKA mutation with a.a.352 Valine to Isoleucine (V352I) was identified from clinical specimens. By using liver-specific transgenic fish overexpressing both the mutant and wild-type AURKA, the AURKA(V352I)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis was earlier and much more severe than wild-type AURKA. Although an increase of the expression of lipogenic enzyme and lipogenic factor was observed in both AURKA(V352I) and AURKA(WT) transgenic fish, AURKA(V352I) has a greater probability to promote fibrosis at 3 months compared to AURKA(WT). Furthermore, the expression levels of cell cycle/proliferation markers were higher in the AURKA(V352I) mutant than AURKA(WT) in transgenic fish, implying that the AURKA(V352I) mutant may accelerate HCC progression. Moreover, we found that the AURKA(V352I) mutant activates AKT signaling and increases nuclear β-catenin, but AURKA(WT) only activates membrane form β-catenin, which may account for the differences. In this study, we provide a new insight, that the AURKA(V352I) mutation contributes to early onset hepatocarcinogenesis, possibly through activation of different pathways than AURKA(WT). This transgenic fish may serve as a drug-screening platform for potential precision medicine therapeutics. ? 2019 by the authors.",AKT signaling pathway; Aurora A kinase (AURKA); Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); Zebrafish; β-catenin,"aurora A kinase; beta catenin; carbohydrate responsive element binding protein; cell protein; connective tissue growth factor; cycline; diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2; fatty acid synthase; heparanase; isoleucine; mammalian target of rapamycin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; phosphatidate phosphatase; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; protein kinase B; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; unclassified drug; valine; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; AURKA gene; cancer growth; cancer incidence; cell cycle; cell proliferation; cola1a1 gene; controlled study; ctgfa gene; disease severity; fibrosis; gene; gene expression; gene mutation; gene overexpression; hpse gene; liver carcinogenesis; nonhuman; protein expression; protein function; protein phosphorylation; transgenic fish; upregulation; zebra fish",2-s2.0-85068699567

Furthermore, patients with a combination of high Axl and low LC3 expression had the highest risk of HCC recurrence (HR: 6.53, 95% CI: 4.11-10.4, P?<?0.001) and mortality (HR: 6.66, 95% CI: 4.07-10.9, P?<?0.001). In patients with high Axl, low LC3, and combined high Axl and low LC3 expression, the 5-year cumulative incidences of HCC recurrence and OS rate?were 77.9%, 73.3%, and 90.0% and 28.8%, 26.7%, and 16.8%, respectively. Conclusion: High Axl expression in tumors is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and worse clinical outcomes. Furthermore, the combination of high Axl and low LC3 expression significantly predicts poorer prognosis for HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy. ? 2019 The Authors.

Thus, it is possible that the genetic polymorphism of COMT can modulate the association of green tea consumption and lung cancer. Here, we designed a case-control study to evaluate the combined effect of green tea consumption and COMT genotypes on the risk of lung cancer. A total of 237 lung cancer patients and 474 healthy controls were recruited. Questionnaires were administered to obtain demographic data, smoking status, green tea consumption, fruits and vegetables intake, exposure to cooking fumes, and family history of lung cancer. Genotypes for COMT were identified by PCR. Smoking, green tea consumption, exposure to cooking fumes, and family history of lung cancer were associated with the development of lung cancer. When green tea drinkers carrying COMT HL/LL genotypes were selected as the reference group, drinkers carrying the COMT HH genotype had a higher risk for the development of lung cancer (odds ratio: 1.97, 95% confidence interval: 0.99-3.91). Among the current and ever smokers, the elevated risk for lung cancer was more apparent in green tea drinkers carrying the COMT HH genotype compared with green tea drinkers carrying COMT HL/LL genotypes (odds ratio: 5.84, 95% confidence interval: 1.75-19.45). Green tea drinkers with greater activity of the COMT genotype, whereby polyphenols are effectively excluded, will gain fewer protective benefits against lung cancer development. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Therefore, it is of utmost importance to study how PT varies across different critical driving situations. PT refers to the time drivers need to recognize the nature and significance of external stimuli. Driver PT is critical when he or she faces a potentially hazardous driving situation, and must determine what action(s) or evasive maneuver(s) to execute. Although past research has identified many factors associated with PT, little research has been done on the effects of critical driving situations on PT, let alone in a real-world driving environment. Naturalistic driving study (NDS) data provides an unprecedented opportunity to look into PT prior to the occurrence of safety-related events. This study seeks to shed light on how critical driving situations influence driver PT, as well as how the driving environment and driver behavior affect PT during real-world driving by utilizing the Second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2) NDS data. An NDS consists of two primary features that distinguish it from retrospective approaches: vehicles are equipped with video camera technologies that observe the driver and the road ahead of the vehicle continuously while driving, and drivers are asked to drive as they normally would. To best study PT while minimizing the effects of confounding factors, this study focused on a total of 1417 rear-end crashes and near crashes. It was found that critical driving situations, the driving environment, and driver behavior are all influential factors in explaining the variation of PT among different drivers. The longest PTs are during critical driving situations where the vehicle ahead is stop-and-go, which can be as long as 2.84 s while controlling for the effects of driving environment and driver behavior factors, compared to other types of driving situations such as a vehicle ahead decelerating or lane changing. ? 2019",Critical driving situation; Driver perception time; Naturalistic driving study,"Automobile drivers; Digital storage; Vehicles; Video cameras; Driver perception time; Driving environment; Driving situations; Influential factors; Naturalistic driving studies; Real-world drivings; Safety-related events; Strategic highway research programs; Behavioral research; car driving; female; human; male; physiology; prevention and control; statistics and numerical data; time perception; traffic accident; videorecording; Accidents, Traffic; Automobile Driving; Female; Humans; Male; Time Perception; Videotape Recording",2-s2.0-85064230850

Notable effects of Zen meditation on autonomic nervous system have been reported during the past decade. Holistic Detox Association (HDA) in Taiwan offered Zen-meditation program to drug addicts as the core scheme among a variety of drug addiction treatments. This paper reports the results of quantifying the cardiorespiratory interactions and autonomic nervous system function to evaluate the on-site effect of Zen meditation on drug rehab. Methods and schemes for quantifying time-domain heart rate variability were employed to electrocardiograph and respiratory signals. Peak-valley method was developed to quantify the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) behavior. Poincar? Plot Analysis was adopted to evaluate the cardiorespiratory functioning. Among 18 voluntary drug addicts during the 10-minute Zen meditation session, about two-third subjects have significant improvement in autonomic nervous system function characterized by heart rate variability (SDNN, RMSSD and pNN50). Group average of RSA increases from 33.43 ms(Rest) to 69.14 ms(AR Zen meditation). Poincar?-plot analysis reveals the improvement of SD1, SD2 and SD2/SD1 by respectively 14.7%, 19.8% and 8.8%. The group averages of all the parameters exhibit significantly positive changes in the 10-minute session of abdominal-respiration Zen meditation.

Given that ConA is a potential anticancer agent for antihepatoma therapy, analytical methods that can be used for ConA detection in plant extracts or biological fluids are important. Labeling agents that can be used to distinguish cancer cells from noncancer cells are also useful for cancer diagnostics. In this study, maltose-directed synthesis of Au nanoparticles (NPs; Au@Maltose NPs) were generated from one-pot reactions and used as sensing probes toward ConA tetrameric forms. Results showed that the binding affinity between Au@Maltose NPs and ConA was desirable with a dissociation constant as low as ?6.66 × 10-8 M. Moreover, the limit of detection against ConA was estimated to be ?23 pM, which was the lowest ever reported when Au NPs were used as sensing probes against ConA. Moreover, Au@Maltose NPs were used as imaging agents for ConA-treated cancer cells, such as human hepatoma HepG2 cells and human breast T-47D cancer cells, which can overexpress mannose N-glycan units on the cell membrane. NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells, which are noncancer cells, were used for comparison.

Research herein entails the design, characterization, and implementation of a structurally simple and cost-effective electro-optical system for mosquito-hunting, which is optimized with a system response time under 1.25 ms considering the average mosquito flight speed of 0.2777 m/s, capable of locating the free-flight adult mosquito and knocking it down, synchronously, without any post data-processing. Empirically, the visible-near-infrared absorption spectra of three mosquito species, namely, Culex piplens molestus, Aedes albopictus, and Armigeres subalbatus, were acquired to examine the disparity in photo-absorption property among different mosquito species and help determine an optimal wavelength for injuring the insects. Armigeres subalbatus, a natural transmission vector of filariasis to humans, was employed for the evaluation of the system’s efficacy. By introducing a free-flight mosquito about 20 cm in front of an dichroic mirror that combines two optical beams for detection and eradication, a dynamically tracking photonic antenna with a maximal area of 45 mm by 39 mm can continuously track the insect and then knock it down by an instant exposure of a lethal beam with average energy ranging from 75 mJ to 155 mJ. Moreover, the dependence of the fate of the insects on the lethal beam energy dosage is statistically assessed. Overall, this research has successfully demonstrated the concept of the synchronizing scheme of identification and eradication with over 60% of mortality rate once the energy dosage is increased above 75mJ, and may be applicable to the control of other insects or avian animals. ? 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.",,Antennas; Cost effectiveness; Data handling; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Infrared devices; Light absorption; Optical systems; Viruses; Dichroic mirrors; Electro-optical systems; Infectious disease; Optimal wavelength; Photo-absorption property; Photonic antenna; System response time; Visible near-infrared; Free flight,2-s2.0-85069182117

In this study, we propose four approaches that suffice to identify and estimate the agonistic interaction: (1) to make a strong assumption that synergism does not exist; (2) to exploit information from a third factor by assuming that this factor is a necessary component for the background condition of synergistic interaction but is not involved in other mechanisms; (3) to consider a third factor necessary for the background condition of agonistic interaction but not involved in other mechanisms; and (4) similar to (3) but to allow flexibility that the third factor may have a main effect on the outcome and/or a synergistic effect with the two risk factors of interest. We applied the proposed methods to quantify the agonism of Hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) infections on liver cancer using a Taiwanese cohort study (n?=?23 820; HBV carrier n?=?4149 (17.44%), HCV carrier n?=?1313 (5.52%)). The result demonstrated that agonistic interaction is more dominant compared with synergistic interaction, which explains the findings that the dual infected patients do not have a significantly higher risk of liver cancer than those with single infection. By exploiting an additional risk factor that satisfies certain assumptions, these approaches potentially fill the gap between mechanistic and causal interactions, contributing the comprehensive understanding of causal mechanisms. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",agonist; causal inference; interaction; mechanism investigation; sufficient component cause model,adult; aged; agonistic interaction; Article; cancer incidence; cancer risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; human; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; risk factor; statistical parameters; Taiwanese,2-s2.0-85062687192

Cardiac abnormalities have been observed in patients with all types of MPS except MPS IX, however few studies have focused on cardiac alterations in patients with MPS III. Methods: We reviewed medical records, echocardiograms, and electrocardiograms of 26 Taiwanese patients with MPS III (five with IIIA, 20 with IIIB, and one with IIIC; 14 males and 12 females; median age, 7.4 years; age range, 1.8-26.5 years). The relationships between age and each echocardiographic parameter were analyzed. Results: Echocardiographic examinations (n = 26) revealed that 10 patients (38%) had valvular heart disease. Four (15%) and eight (31%) patients had valvular stenosis or regurgitation, respectively. The most prevalent cardiac valve abnormality was mitral regurgitation (31%), followed by aortic regurgitation (19%). However, most of the cases of valvular heart disease were mild. Three (12%), five (19%) and five (19%) patients had mitral valve prolapse, a thickened interventricular septum, and asymmetric septal hypertrophy, respectively. The severity of aortic regurgitation and the existence of valvular heart disease, aortic valve abnormalities and valvular stenosis were all positively correlated with increasing age (p < 0.05). Z scores > 2 were identified in 0, 38, 8, and 27% of left ventricular mass index, interventricular septal end-diastolic dimension, left ventricular posterior wall end-diastolic dimension, and aortic diameter, respectively. Electrocardiograms in 11 patients revealed the presence of sinus arrhythmia (n = 3), sinus bradycardia (n = 2), and sinus tachycardia (n = 1). Six patients with MPS IIIB had follow-up echocardiographic data at 1.9-18.1 years to compare with the baseline data, which showed some patients had increased thickness of the interventricular septum, as well as more patients had valvular abnormalities at follow-up. Conclusions: Cardiac involvement in MPS III is less common and milder compared with other types of MPS. The existence of valvular heart disease, aortic valve abnormalities and valvular stenosis in the patients worsened with increasing age, reinforcing the concept of the progressive nature of this disease. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Cardiac; Echocardiography; Electrocardiography; Mucopolysaccharidosis III; Valvular heart disease,adolescent; adult; age distribution; aging; aorta; aortic regurgitation; Article; cardiovascular parameters; child; clinical article; clinical feature; controlled study; disease course; disease severity; echocardiography; electrocardiography; female; follow up; heart disease; heart hypertrophy; heart left ventricle mass; heart left ventricle posterior wall enddiastolic dimension; heart valve stenosis; heart ventricle septum defect; human; interventricular septum end diastolic dimension; interventricular septum hypertrophy; male; medical record review; mitral valve prolapse; mitral valve regurgitation; preschool child; retrospective study; Sanfilippo syndrome; school child; sinus arrhythmia; sinus bradycardia; sinus tachycardia; Taiwanese; valvular heart disease; young adult,2-s2.0-85067279253

Crystal structure of A26 protein revealed that His48 and His53 are in close contact with Lys47, Arg57, His314 and Arg312, suggesting that at low pH these His-cation pairs could initiate conformational changes through protonation of His48 and His53 and subsequent electrostatic repulsion. All the A26 mutant mature viruses that interrupted His-cation pair interactions of His48 and His 53 indeed have lost virion infectivity. Isolation of revertant viruses revealed that second site mutations caused frame shifts and premature termination of A26 protein such that reverent viruses regained cell entry through plasma membrane fusion.

Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is the predominant risk factor for HCC in the US and Europe. Multiple epidemiological studies showed that sustained virological responses (SVR) following treatment with the powerful direct acting antivirals (DAAs), which have replaced interferon-based regimes, do not eliminate tumor development. We aimed to identify an HCV-specific pathogenic mechanism that persists post SVR following DAAs treatment. We demonstrate that HCV infection induces genome-wide epigenetic changes by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for histone post-translational modifications that are epigenetic markers for active and repressed chromatin. The changes in histone modifications correlate with reprogramed host gene expression and alter signaling pathways known to be associated with HCV life cycle and HCC. These epigenetic alterations require the presence of HCV RNA or/and expression of the viral proteins in the cells. Importantly, the epigenetic changes induced following infection persist as an ""epigenetic signature"" after virus eradication by DAAs treatment, as detected using in vitro HCV infection models. These observations led to the identification of an 8 gene signature that is associated with HCC development and demonstrate persistent epigenetic alterations in HCV infected and post SVR liver biopsy samples. The epigenetic signature was reverted in vitro by drugs that inhibit epigenetic modifying enzyme and by the EGFR inhibitor, Erlotinib. This epigenetic “scarring” of the genome, persisting following HCV eradication, suggest a novel mechanism for the persistent pathogenesis of HCV after its eradication by DAAs. Our study offers new avenues for prevention of the persistent oncogenic effects of chronic hepatitis infections using specific drugs to revert the epigenetic changes to the genome. ? 2019 Perez et al.",,"antivirus agent; dasabuvir; erlotinib; kruppel like factor 4; ombitasvir; paritaprevir; proprotein convertase 9; ritonavir; transcription factor JunB; viral protein; virus RNA; Wnt10a protein; antivirus agent; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; histone; interferon; histone; nonstructural protein 2; antiviral therapy; Article; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; EDN1 gene; epigenetic signature; epigenetics; FOSL2 gene; gene; gene expression; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus; histone modification; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; JUNB gene; KLF4 gene; liver biopsy; liver cell carcinoma; MYCN gene; next generation sequencing; PCSK9 gene; protein expression; signal transduction; sustained virologic response; TNFAIP3 gene; viral clearance; WNT10A gene; aged; biopsy; chromatin; drug effect; female; gene expression regulation; genetic epigenesis; genetics; Hepacivirus; hepatitis C; histone code; host pathogen interaction; liver; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; male; middle aged; pathogenicity; pathology; risk factor; virology; antiviral therapy; cancer risk; cell structure; disease association; genetic association; hepatitis C; life cycle stage; nonhuman; protein processing; virus replication; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Biopsy; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Chromatin; Epigenesis, Genetic; ErbB Receptors; Erlotinib Hydrochloride; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C; Histone Code; Histones; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Interferons; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Signal Transduction; Sustained Virologic Response",2-s2.0-85069265626

Recently, evolutionary conservation has been indicated to contain informative signatures for functional significance in cancers. However, the importance of evolutionary conservation in distinguishing cancer subtypes remains largely unclear. Here, we identified the evolutionarily conserved genes (i.e. core genes) and observed that they are primarily involved in cellular pathways relevant to cell growth and metabolisms. By using these core genes, we developed two novel strategies, namely a feature-based strategy (FES) and an image-based strategy (IMS) by integrating their evolutionary and genomic profiles with the deep learning algorithm. In comparison with the FES using the random set and the strategy using the PAM50 classifier, the core gene set-based FES achieved a higher accuracy for identifying breast cancer subtypes. The IMS and FES using the core gene set yielded better performances than the other strategies, in terms of classifying both breast cancer subtypes and multiple cancer types. Moreover, the IMS is reproducible even using different gene expression data (i.e. RNA-seq and microarray). Comprehensive analysis of eight cancer types demonstrates that our evolutionary conservation-based models represent a valid and helpful approach for identifying cancer subtypes and the core gene set offers distinguishable clues of cancer subtypes. ? 2019 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.",cancer genomics; Cancer subtype; convolutional neural network; copy number alteration; deep learning; evolutionary conservation; gene expression,,2-s2.0-85068997887

About 70% of PCa patients were diagnosed at later stage, and metastasis has been observed. Additionally, the cure rate of PCa closely relies on the early diagnosis with biomarkers. The identification of biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis is an urgent clinical issue for PCa. Here, we developed a novel scoring strategy, including cluster score (CS) and predicting score (PS), to identify 29 PCa genes (called PCa29) for early diagnostic biomarkers from two datasets in Gene Expression Omnibus. The result indicates that PCa29 can discriminate between normal and tumor tissues and are specific for prostate cancer. To validate PCa29, we found that 97% of PCa29 were consistently significant with these gene expressions in The Cancer Genome Atlas; furthermore, a70% of PCa29 are consensus to the protein expression in The Human Protein Atlas. Finally, we examined 10 genes in PCa29 on three PCa cell lines by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The experimental results show that the trend of the differential PCa29 expression is consistent with the analyzed results from our novel scoring method. We believe that our method is useful and PCa29 are potential biomarkers that provide the clues to develop targeting therapy for PCa. ? 2019 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.",biomarkers; diagnosis; gene expression profiling; Prostate cancer; protein-protein interaction network,,2-s2.0-85068977496

Sorafenib was the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for treating advanced HCC until recently, so development of new target therapy is urgently needed. In this study, we established a zebrafish drug screening platform and compared the therapeutic effects of two multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 419S1 and 420S1, with Sorafenib. All three compounds exhibited anti-angiogenesis abilities in immersed fli1:EGFP transgenic embryos and the half inhibition concentration (IC50) was determined. 419S1 exhibited lower hepatoxicity and embryonic toxicity than 420S1 and Sorafenib, and the half lethal concentration (LC50) was determined. The therapeutic index (LC50/IC50) for 419S1 was much higher than for Sorafenib and 420S1. The compounds were either injected retro-orbitally or by oral gavage to adult transgenic zebrafish with HCC. The compounds not only rescued the pathological feature, but also reversed the expression levels of cell-cycle-related genes and protein levels of a proliferation marker. Using a patient-derived-xenograft assay, we found that the effectiveness of 419S1 and 420S1 in preventing liver cancer proliferation is better than that of Sorafenib. With integrated efforts and the advantage of the zebrafish platform, we can find more effective and safe drugs for HCC treatment and screen for personalized medicine. ? 2019 by the authors.

Methods: Patients who received an OCTA examination were divided into progressed HTG, progressed NTG, and well-controlled HTG (control) groups. Superficial macular vessel density (SmVD), deep macular vessel density (DmVD), foveal avascular zone (FAZ), and flow area of the outer retina and choriocapillaris were obtained by one OCTA device. Associations between macular angiography and glaucoma parameters, including the visual field, retinal nerve fiber layer, and ganglion cell complex, were analyzed. Results: A total of 60 eyes from 60 patients were enrolled. The progressed HTG and NTG groups had lower SmVD than the control group, while the progressed NTG group had lower DmVD and a larger FAZ than the control group. The flow area of the outer retina in the progressed HTG group was lower than that of the control. A significant correlation between SmVD and glaucoma parameters was found in the progressed HTG group, while a similar correlation between SmVD and DmVD to glaucoma parameters was observed in the progressed NTG group.

Although vocal emotion has been explored in previous studies, little is known about how perception of different vocal emotional expressions modulates the functional brain network topology. In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional brain networks under different attributes of vocal emotion by graph-theoretical network analysis. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments were performed on 36 healthy participants.We utilized the Power-264 functional brain atlas to calculate the interregional functional connectivity (FC) from fMRI data under resting state and vocal stimuli at different arousal and valence levels. The orthogonal minimal spanning trees method was used for topological filtering. The paired-sample t-test with Bonferroni correction across all regions and arousal-valence levels were used for statistical comparisons. Our results show that brain network exhibits significantly altered network attributes at FC, nodal and global levels, especially under high-arousal or negative-valence vocal emotional stimuli. The alterations within/between well-known large-scale functional networks were also investigated. Through the present study, we have gained more insights into how comprehending emotional speech modulates brain networks.

Research has shown that early screenings for chronic diseases are an effective way of lowering incidence and mortality rates. However, low participation rates for health screening is one of the main challenges for preventive medicine. The objective of this study was to determine the primary drivers which: (1) first motivate people to participate in community-based health screening for chronic diseases; and (2) increase their willingness to continue to participate. Methods: A total of 440 individuals between 30 and 75 years of age were invited to undergo a health screening and then complete an interview questionnaire. Screenings and interviews were conducted in four regions in northern Taiwan. The questionnaire was separated into three sections, which explored sociodemographic differences, drivers of willingness to participate, and willingness to continue to participate respectively. Raw data was analyzed using the statistical software package SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Main Outcome Measures: Effects of sociodemographic factors on health screening participation rate, drivers of willingness to participate, and willingness to continue to participate. Results: Seventy-three percent of participants responded that they would be willing to continue to join in future health screenings. Notably, elderly people and married people were respectively more likely to participate in preventive health screening than were younger people and people who were single, divorced, separated, or widowed. Level of education was another key driver of willingness to participate in health screening for chronic diseases, as were the concern of relatives/friends and the provision of participation incentives. Discussion: Some of our findings, such as the key drivers of willingness to continue to participate in health screening that we identified, were different from findings of many previous studies conducted in other countries. The current study also found that a higher percentage of participants would be willing to join a similar health screening in the future if the service design is considered in advance and is well-implemented. ? 2019 by the authors.

However, 15%-20% of CML patients ultimately develop resistance to imatinib and then progress to an accelerated phase and eventually to a blast crisis, limiting treatment options and resulting in a poor survival rate. Thus, we investigated whether histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) could be used as a potential anticancer therapy for imatinib-resistant CML (IR-CML) patients. By applying a noninvasive apoptosis detection sensor (NIADS), we found that panobinostat significantly enhanced cell apoptosis in K562 cells. A further investigation showed that panobinostat induced apoptosis in both K562 and imatinib-resistant K562 (IR-K562) cells mainly via H3 and H4 histone acetylation, whereas panobinostat targeted cancer stem cells (CSCs) in IR-K562 cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing, we found that HDAC1 and HDAC2 knockout cells significantly induced cell apoptosis, indicating that the regulation of HDAC1 and HDAC2 is extremely important in maintaining K562 cell survival.

The current study aimed to address the treatment efficacy and safety of DAAs in patients with curative or active HCC, compared with those of patients without HCC. Design A prospective cohort study Setting A medical centre and two regional hospitals in Taiwan Participants A total of 713 Taiwanese patients (601 non-HCC, 74 curative HCC and 38 active HCC patients) who received standard-of-care DAAs were consecutively enrolled in the study. Main outcome measurement The primary objective was to determine treatment efficacy, defined as undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA throughout 12 weeks of the post-treatment follow-up period (sustained virological response 12 [SVR12]). Results The overall SVR12 rate was 96.9%. The SVR12 rate was similar between the patients with HCC and those without HCC (95.5% vs 97.2%, p=0.37). The HCC patients were divided into two groups, those with curative HCC and those with viable HCC; a substantially but not significantly lower SVR rate, 92.1% (35/38), was observed in the patients with viable HCC compared with the SVR rate, 97.3% (72/74), in those with curative HCC (p=0.33). Compared with the patients with curative HCC, the patients with viable HCC had a significantly higher proportion of serious adverse events (10.5% vs 1.0%, p=0.002), early treatment discontinuation (10.5% vs 2.8%, p=0.03) and mortality (5.3% vs 0.1%, p=0.008). Conclusions An equivalently high SVR rate was observed in patients with either past or active HCC compared with those without HCC.

To greatly reduce the computation complexity, several time-domain multirate signal processing techniques, such as the up- and down-sampling rate conversions and the interpolated finite impulse response (IFIR) filters, were investigated. However, it is well known that using fast Fourier transform (FFT) to perform the linear convolution can dramatically reduce the computational complexity. Taking both advantages, in this brief we investigated the FFT-based multirate signal-processing technique and explored their efficient architecture. To demonstrate the success of the proposed architecture, we implemented a real-valued FFT-based 10.7-ms, 18-band quasi-ANSI 1/3-octave filter bank using TSMC 90-nm CMOS high-VT technology. We found that, for each input sample, the proposed FFT-based quasi-ANSI 1/3-octave filter bank used approximately 77% fewer multiplications than the previous time-domain design. The proposed FFT-based quasi-ANSI filter bank was operated at 13 MHz to process the 24-KHz audio in real time, and it consumed only 14 μW (@0.9V) of dynamic power. ? 2004-2012 IEEE.",frequency-domain multirate signal processing; hearing aids; Low-latency quasi-ANSI filter bank,Audition; Fast Fourier transforms; Filter banks; Frequency domain analysis; Hearing aids; Impulse response; Signal sampling; Characteristic analysis; Computation complexity; Efficient architecture; Interpolated finite impulse response; Low latency; Multirate signal processing; Proposed architectures; Time domain designs; Time domain analysis,2-s2.0-85065445198

However, as a new biomarker, enormous clinical trials are required to define the intended-use and to verify the specification. In this report, we demonstrated a low-cost easy-operated real-time sensing system (optical fiber-urea-sensing, OFUS, system) to detect salivary urea. We aim to make the system easily reproduced by the community to stimulate abundant clinical tests worldwide. The OFUS system is composed of a simple three-dimensional printed tank to link with two optical fibers, one connecting with a commercial light-emitting diode to deliver the input light signal, the other connecting with a commercial cadmium sulfide photo-conductive cell to detect the sensing signal. To allow on-site detection without any sample pretreatment, only 1 μl saliva is needed to be mixed with 10 μl urease solution and 90 μl pH indicator solution in the reaction tank and the detection time is only 20 s. A stable and reproducible calibration curve can be easily built with a detection range as 24–300 mg/dL. The OFUS system successfully detected saliva with added synthetic urea and samples from chronic kidney disease patients. A good agreement between the OFUS system and the ?commercial kit was obtained. A good correlation between salivary urea and the blood urea nitrogen was also confirmed. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Non-invasive; Optical fiber; Point-of-care; Real-time; Salivary urea,3D printers; Biomarkers; Blood; Cadmium sulfide; Costs; II-VI semiconductors; Metabolism; Nitrogen; Optical fibers; Sulfur compounds; Tanks (containers); Blood urea nitrogens; Calibration curves; Chronic kidney disease; Good correlations; Non-invasive; Point of care; Real time; Sample pretreatment; Urea; biological marker; cadmium sulfide; nitrogen; urea; urease; Article; blood analysis; calculation; calibration; catalysis; chronic kidney failure; correlational study; cost effectiveness analysis; human; point of care testing; saliva analysis; three dimensional printing; urea nitrogen blood level,2-s2.0-85062945375

Here, we applied entropy analysis to the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) signal in subjects with late-life depression (LLD), an illness combined with emotion dysregulation and aging effect. Methods: A total of 35 unremitted depressed elderly and 22 control subjects were recruited. Multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis was performed in the entire brain, 90 automated anatomical labeling-parcellated ROIs, and five resting networks in each study participant. Limitations: Due to ethical concerns, all the participants were under medication during the study. Results: Regionally, subjects with LLD showed decreased entropy only in the right posterior cingulate gyrus but had universally increased entropy in affective processing (putamen and thalamus), sensory, motor, and temporal nodes across different time scales. We also found higher entropy in the left frontoparietal network (FPN), which partially mediated the negative correlation between depression severity and mental components of the quality of life, reflecting the possible neural compensation during depression treatment. Conclusion: MSE provides a novel and complementary approach in rs-fMRI analysis. The temporal-spatial complexity in the resting brain may provide the adaptive variability beneficial for the elderly with depression. ? 2019",Depression; Entropy; Late-life; Quality of life; Resting-state fMRI,adult; aged; aging; Article; brain; clinical article; controlled study; emotion; entropy; female; frontoparietal cortex; functional magnetic resonance imaging; Geriatric Depression Scale; geriatric patient; human; late life depression; male; mental health; posterior cingulate; priority journal; putamen; quality of life; thalamus; brain; brain mapping; cingulate gyrus; depression; entropy; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; psychology; quality of life; rest; antidepressant agent; Aged; Antidepressive Agents; Brain; Brain Mapping; Depressive Disorder; Entropy; Female; Gyrus Cinguli; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Rest; Thalamus,2-s2.0-85062700960

However, imatinib resistance remains a common clinical issue. Andrographolide, the major compound of the medicinal plant Andrographis paniculata, was reported to exhibit anticancer activity. In this study, we explored the therapeutic potential of andrographolide and its derivative, NCTU-322, against both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant human CML cell lines. Both andrographolide and NCTU-322 downregulated the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein in imatinib-resistant CML cells through an Hsp90-dependent mechanism similar to that observed in imatinib-sensitive CML cells. In addition, NCTU-322 had stronger effects than andrographolide on downregulation of Bcr-Abl oncoprotein, induction of Hsp90 cleavage and cytotoxicity of CML cells. Notably, andrographolide and NCTU-322 could induce differentiation, mitotic arrest and apoptosis of both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML cells. Finally, the anticancer activity of NCTU-322 against imatinib-resistant CML cells was demonstrated in vivo. In summary, our data demonstrated that andrographolide and NCTU-322 inhibit Bcr-abl function via a mechanism different from that of imatinib, and they induced multiple anticancer effects in both imatinib-sensitive and resistant CML cells. Our findings demonstrate that andrographolide and NCTU-322 are potential therapeutic agents again CML. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Andrographolide; Bcr-Abl; Chronic myelogenous leukemia; Drug resistance; Imatinib,"alanine aminotransferase; andrographolide; antineoplastic agent; aspartate aminotransferase; BCR ABL protein; caspase 3; creatinine; diterpenoid; glycoprotein E1; heat shock protein 90; histone H3; imatinib; nctu 322; STAT5 protein; unclassified drug; andrographolide; antineoplastic agent; diterpene; imatinib; Andrographis paniculata; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer resistance; cell cycle; cell differentiation; cell viability; chronic myeloid leukemia; controlled study; cytoplasm; down regulation; drug mechanism; human; human cell; IC50; in vivo study; K-562 cell line; KBM-5 cell line; leukemia cell; metaphase; missense mutation; mitosis inhibition; mouse; nonhuman; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; priority journal; protein cleavage; protein function; urea nitrogen blood level; Western blotting; cell cycle checkpoint; cell survival; chemical structure; chemistry; chronic myeloid leukemia; drug effect; drug resistance; gene expression regulation; genetics; mononuclear cell; oncogene; physiology; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Diterpenes; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genes, abl; Humans; Imatinib Mesylate; Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Molecular Structure",2-s2.0-85062417831

Design: Cluster randomized trial. Setting: Two 36-bed GI wards at a university-affiliated medical center in Taiwan. Participants: Older patients (?65 years, N = 377)were recruited if they were scheduled for elective GI surgery with an expected length of hospital stay >6 days. After transferring to the GI ward after surgery, participants were randomly assigned to the mHELP or control group (1:1)by room rather than individually because most patient units are double- or triple-occupancy rooms. Intervention: The mHELP protocols (early mobilization, oral and nutritional assistance, and orienting communication)were administered daily with usual care by a trained nurse until hospital discharge. The control group received usual care only. Measures: Outcomes were in-hospital nutritional decline, measured by body weight and Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA)scores, and Fried's frailty phenotype. Return of GI motility was examined as a potential mechanism contributing to observed outcomes. Results: Participants (mean age = 74.5 years; 56.8% male)primarily underwent colorectal (56.5%), gastric (21.2%), and pancreatobiliary (13.8%)surgery. Participants who received the mHELP [for a median of 7 days (interquartile range = 6–10 days)]had significantly lower in-hospital weight loss and decline in MNA scores (weight ?2.1 vs ?4.0 lb, P =.002; score ?3.2 vs ?4.0, P =.03)than the control group. The mHELP group also had significantly lower rates of incident frailty during hospitalization (12.0% vs 21.7%, P =.022), and persistent frailty (50.0% vs 92.9%, P =.03). Participants in the mHELP group had trends toward an accelerated return of GI motility. Conclusion and Implications: The mHELP effectively reduced nutritional decline, prevented new frailty, and promoted recovery of frailty present before admission.

In order to improve the above issue, several hearing aids have been developed to enhance the speech signal in noisy environment. Most of current hearing aids were designed to enhance the component of speech and suppress the component of noise. However, it is difficult to separate other speech sources. Adaptive signal enhancement with the beamforming technique might improve the above issue. However, how to distinguish the location of the desired speaker effectively is still a difficult challenge for adaptive beamforming method. A novel concept of hearing aid was proposed in this study. Different from the beamforming-based hearing aids, which use the cross-correlation-coefficient method to estimate time difference of arrival (TDOA), an image recognition technology was used to estimate the location of the desired speaker to obtain the more precise TDOA. An adaptive signal enhancement was also used to enhance the noisy speech sound. From the experimental results, the proposed system could provide a smaller absolute error of TDOA less than 1.25 × 10 -4 ms, and a clear speech sound from the target speaker who the user wants to listen to. ? 2018 IEEE.",adaptive filter; cross-correlation-coefficient; Hearing aids; image recognition technology; time difference of arrival,"Acoustic noise; Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Beamforming; Biomedical signal processing; Hearing aids; Image enhancement; Image recognition; Medical imaging; Microphones; Speech communication; Speech enhancement; Speech intelligibility; Speech recognition; System buses; Time difference of arrival; Biomedical imaging; Cross-correlation coefficient; Image recognition technology; Noise measurements; Universal serial bus; Audition; algorithm; Article; correlation analysis; correlation coefficient; equipment design; facial recognition; image enhancement; image processing; image recognition; information processing; mathematical analysis; noise; signal noise ratio; signal processing; sound detection; sound transmission; speech intelligibility; devices; hearing aid; human; image processing; physiology; procedures; speech; Algorithms; Hearing Aids; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Noise; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Sound Spectrography; Speech",2-s2.0-85047020886

Visfatin, which is known as an obesity-related cytokine with pro-inflammatory activities, plays a role in regulation of inflammatory cytokines. The mechanisms of ALI remain unclear in critically ill patients. Survival in ALI patients appear to be influenced by the stress generated by mechanical ventilation and by ALI-associated factors that initiate the inflammatory response. The objective for this study was to understand the mechanisms of how visfatin regulates inflammatory cytokines and promotes ALI. The expression of visfatin was evaluated in ALI patients and mouse sepsis models. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms were investigated using human bronchial epithelial cell lines, BEAS-2B and NL-20. An increase of serum visfatin was discovered in ALI patients compared to normal controls. Results from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry staining also showed that visfatin protein was upregulated in mouse sepsis models. Moreover, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced visfatin expression, activated the STAT3/NFκB pathway, and increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL1-β, IL-6, and TNF-α in human bronchial epithelial cell lines NL-20 and BEAS-2B. Co-treatment of visfatin inhibitor FK866 reversed the activation of the STAT3/NFκB pathway and the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by LPS. Our study provides new evidence for the involvement of visfatin and down-stream events in acute lung injury.

Here, Ag/AgCl electrodes with conductive gels are usually used in a 12-lead ECG system to access biopotentials. However, using Ag/AgCl electrodes with conductive gels might be inconvenient in a prehospital setting. In previous studies, several dry electrodes have been developed to improve this issue. However, these dry electrodes have contact with the skin directly, and they might be still unsuitable for patients with wounds. In this study, a wearable 12-lead electrocardiogram monitoring system was proposed to improve the above issue. Here, novel noncontact electrodes were also designed to access biopotentials without contact with the skin directly. Moreover, by using the mechanical design, this system allows the user to easily wear and take off the device and to adjust the locations of the noncontact electrodes. The experimental results showed that the proposed system could exactly provide a good ECG signal quality even while walking and could detect the ECG features of the patients with myocardial ischemia, installation pacemaker, and ventricular premature contraction. ? 2019 by the authors.

While surgery is the most effective treatment for oral cancer, it frequently causes deformity and dysfunction in the orofacial region. In this study, methyl aminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT) as a prevention tool against progression of precancerous lesion to oral cancer was explored. Methods: For in vitro studies, we evaluated the effects of MAL-PDT on viability of DOK oral precancerous cells by XTT, cell morphology by TEM, and intracellular signaling pathways by flow cytometry, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. For in vivo study, DMBA was used to induce oral precancerous lesions in hamsters followed by MAL-PDT treatment. We measured tumor size and body weight weekly. After sacrifice, buccal pouch lesions were processed for H&amp;E stain and immunohistochemistry analysis. Results: MAL-PDT induced autophagic cell death in DOK oral precancerous cells. The autophagy-related markers LC3II and p62/SQSTM1 and autophagosome formation in DOK cells were increased after MAL-PDT treatment. In vivo, Metvix ? -PDT treatment decreased tumor growth and enhanced LC3II expression in hamster buccal pouch tumors induced by DMBA. Conclusions: Our in vitro and in vivo results suggest that MAL-PDT may provide an effective therapy for oral precancerous lesions through induction of autophagic cell death. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

To date, the objective evidence to link pathophysiological effects and actual reactions triggered by KT is limited. Purpose: To explore the effect of KT on the lumbar paraspinal muscles by magnetic resonance (MR) elastography. Study Type: Prospective observational study. Population: Sixty-six asymptomatic volunteers with 31 women and 35 men. Field Strength/Sequence: 3.0T MRI and elastography with vibration frequency of 120 Hz. Assessment: The 5-cm-width KT with full tension was placed on a single side of the lumbar paraspinal muscle. The taping side and adhering direction were randomly decided. Two rectangular regions of interest (ROIs) of 5- and 2.5-cm-width were positioned at the bilateral paraspinal regions from the L2 to L4 level on the confidence map of MR elastography before and after KT taping. The mean shear stiffness values of the ROIs at the superficial, middle, and deep depths were recorded; then the differences between the taping and reference sides were calculated. Statistical Tests: Paired t-test and Pearson correlations were used to evaluate the stiffness changes after KT application and intraoperator errors of the stiffness measures on the reference side, respectively. Results: A significant decrease in the muscle stiffness value between taping and reference sides (–0.71 kPa ± 0.60 with KT and –0.25 kPa ± 0.78 without KT, P < 0.0001 for 5-cm ROI; –0.67 kPa ± 1.12 with KT and –0.16 kPa ± 1.17 without KT, P = 0.0004 for 2.5-cm ROI) was found in the superficial depth, but no significant differences in the middle and deep depths (P = 0.25 and P = 0.79 for 5-cm ROI; P = 0.09 and P = 0.67 for 2.5-cm ROI, respectively). There were no significant differences of muscle stiffness differences between gender (P = 0.11 for superficial, P = 0.37 for middle, P = 0.78 for deep) and taping direction (P = 0.18 for superficial, P = 0.13 for middle, P = 0.15 for deep).

The high incidence of second esophageal neoplasia is one of the major causes. To establish an efficient follow-up scheme for increasing the diagnostic yield and reducing the adverse impact of second esophageal neoplasia on survival, the purpose of this study was to explore a biomarker to predict second esophageal neoplasia. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, consecutive tissue specimens from those patients who underwent tumor resection between September 2007 and October 2015 were collected. Gene amplification was performed by real-time PCR. The expression of cortactin was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The predictive risk factors of developing second esophageal neoplasia and prognostic factors related to survival were analyzed. Results: A total of 187 patients were included with a mean follow-up of 48 months (12–118 months). Second esophageal tumors were found in 53 (28.3%), including 41 (21.9%) esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and 12 severe dysplasia. The results of multivariate analyses revealed that age (OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.16–6.78), cortactin overexpression (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.17–5.33), and stage IV versus I (OR 6.49, 95% CI 1.68–25.18) were independent predictors of second esophageal neoplasia, and second esophageal neoplasia (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.05–3.01) was an independent predictor of overall survival. Conclusion: This is the first report to identify a potential biomarker for predicting second esophageal neoplasia in patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma. In those patients with cortactin overexpression and younger age (?60 years old), close surveillance for second esophageal neoplasia is required. In addition, the real effect of cortactin overexpression on development of primary esophageal carcinoma is required to be validated in a large cohort study. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Cortactin; CTTN gene; EMS1 gene; Hypopharyngeal cancer; Second esophageal cancer,"cortactin; cortactin; CTTN protein, human; adult; age; aged; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cohort analysis; diagnostic value; distant metastasis; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus dysplasia; esophagus tumor; female; follow up; gene amplification; human; human tissue; hypopharynx carcinoma; immunohistochemistry; major clinical study; male; overall survival; perineural invasion; retrospective study; second cancer; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus tumor; genetics; head and neck tumor; hypopharynx tumor; Kaplan Meier method; metabolism; middle aged; multivariate analysis; odds ratio; prognosis; proportional hazards model; second cancer; statistical model; survival rate; very elderly; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Cortactin; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Hypopharyngeal Neoplasms; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Neoplasms, Second Primary; Odds Ratio; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck; Survival Rate",2-s2.0-85051411963

Many risk factors are well documented for in cholangiocarcinoma, but the impacts of advanced biliary interventions, like endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES), endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation (EPBD), and cholecystectomy, are inconsistent in the previous literature. AIM To clarify the risks of cholangiocarcinoma after ES/EPBD, cholecystectomy or no intervention for cholelithiasis using the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). METHODS From data of NHIRD 2004-2011 in Taiwan, we selected 7938 cholelithiasis cases as well as 23814 control group cases (matched by sex and age in a 1:3 ratio). We compared the previous risk factors of cholangiocarcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma rate in the cholelithiasis and control groups. The incidences of total and subsequent cholangiocarcinoma were calculated in ES/EPBD patients, cholecystectomy patients, cholelithiasis patients without intervention, and groups from the normal population. RESULTS In total, 537 cases underwent ES/EPBD, 1743 cases underwent cholecystectomy, and 5658 cholelithiasis cases had no intervention. Eleven (2.05%), 37 (0.65%), and 7 (0.40%) subsequent cholangiocarcinoma cases were diagnosed in the ES/EPBD, no intervention, and cholecystectomy groups, respectively, and the odds ratio for subsequent cholangiocarcinoma was 3.13 in the ES/EPBD group and 0.61 in the cholecystectomy group when compared with the no intervention group. CONCLUSION In conclusion, symptomatic cholelithiasis patients who undergo cholecystectomy can reduce the incidence of subsequent cholangiocarcinoma, while cholelithiasis patients who undergo ES/EPBD are at a great risk of subsequent cholangiocarcinoma according to our findings. ?

Scientists have tried to prepare bimodal reporters by combining fluorescent dyes with metal nanomaterials, but their fluorescence was easily quenched by metal nanomaterials through surface energy transfer, making dual colorimetric and fluorometric ICTS very difficult to be achieved. As compared to conventional fluorescent probes, semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) exhibit extraordinary fluorescence brightness and facile surface functionalization, which are very suitable to be engineered as bimodal signal reporting reagents. Here, we integrated highly fluorescent Pdots with strongly plasmonic Au nanorods to form Pdot-Au hybrid nanocomposites with dual colorimetric and fluorescent readout abilities. We further utilized these nanohybrids in ICTS for qualitatively fast screening (colorimetry) as well as quantitatively accurate determination (fluorometry) of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) within 10 min. By taking advantage of the plasmon-enhanced fluorescence of Pdots on Au nanorods, this immunoassay possesses much better detection sensitivity of 1.07 pg/mL for PSA, which is at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional fluorometric ICTS. Moreover, the direct detection of PSA from human whole blood collected without sample pretreatment makes this Pdot-based ICTS platform promising for on-site point-of-care diagnostics. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.",biomarker detection; dual-mode test strip; PSA POC monitoring; semiconducting polymer dots; whole-blood analysis,Antigens; Biomarkers; Blood; Color; Colorimetry; Energy transfer; Gold; Immunology; Nanorods; Nanostructured materials; Plasmonics; Plasmons; Polymers; Detection sensitivity; Dual modes; Enhanced fluorescence; Hybrid nanocomposites; Point of care diagnostic; Prostate specific antigen; Surface Functionalization; Whole blood; Fluorescence; fluorescent dye; nanocomposite; polymer; prostate specific antigen; quantum dot; chemistry; colorimetry; fluorescent antibody technique; human; immunoassay; isolation and purification; limit of detection; procedures; semiconductor; Colorimetry; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Fluorescent Dyes; Humans; Immunoassay; Limit of Detection; Nanocomposites; Polymers; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Quantum Dots; Semiconductors,2-s2.0-85062472720

Users perceive a physical support on a finger attached to a string, when extending their arm and reaching out to the string's maximum extension. This physical support assists users in precise touch interaction in the context of stationary and walking virtual or mixed-reality experiences. We propose three methods of attachment of the haptic string (directly on the head or on the body), and illustrate a novel single-step calibration algorithm that supports these configurations by estimating a grand haptic sphere, once a head-coordinated touch interaction is established. Two user studies were conducted to validate our approach and to compare the touch performance with physical support in sitting and walking conditions in the context of mobile mixed-reality scenarios. The results show that, in the walking condition, touch interaction with physical support significantly outperformed the visual-only condition. ? 2019 IEEE.",Centered computing; Centered computing; Human; Human; Treemaps; Visualization; Visualization; Visualization design and evaluation methods; Visualization techniques,Flow visualization; Helmet mounted displays; Human computer interaction; User interfaces; Visualization; Walking aids; Wearable technology; Centered computing; Human; Tree-maps; Visualization designs; Visualization technique; Mixed reality,2-s2.0-85071840867

Of the all enrollees, 1,113 in the PSD cohort and 2,611 in the non-PSD cohort (1,180.96 vs. 954.68 per 100,000 person-year) developed psychiatric disorders. Multivariate Cox regression model survival analysis revealed that, after adjusting for gender, age, monthly income, urbanization level, geographic region, and comorbidities, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 2.448 (95% CI [2.227, 2.633], p <.001). PSD has been associated with the increased risk in anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, sleep disorders, and psychotic disorders, respectively.

The postprocedure bleeding rate for EPBD is low in the normal population; however, this bleeding rate in a group of patients prone to bleeding, such as patients with end-stage renal disease, is not well-established. We therefore evaluated the post-EST and post-EPBD bleeding rate among hemodialysis (HD) patients based on data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Patients and Methods: The NHIRD entries for a population of 2 million were screened for patients who had a catastrophic illness card for HD between 1 st January 2004 and 31 st December 2011 and these patients were enrolled as research subjects. The rates of major gastrointestinal tract bleeding events appearing within 14 days after EST or EPBD were compared between HD and non-HD patients. Results: A total of 3561 patients, over 18 years of age and without liver cirrhosis or hematologic diseases, underwent 3826 EST and 280 EPBD procedures during the 8 calendar years selected for our analysis. The total post-ERCP major bleeding rate was much higher in HD than in non-HD patients (8.64% vs. 2.16%, P &lt; 0.0001). The rate of postprocedure major bleeding events was lower for non-HD patients who underwent EPBD than those who underwent EST (0.75% vs. 2.26%; P = 0.049), whereas the postprocedure major bleeding event rates were similar in HD patients who underwent either EPBD or EST (8.70% vs. 8.33%; P = 0.484). Conclusion: Post-ERCP, post-EST, and post-EPBD major bleeding rates were all higher in HD patients in this study. EPBD resulted in lower postprocedure major bleeding events than EST in the non-HD population, but it failed to provide the reduction in bleeding events needed to perform endoscopic hemostasis in HD patients. ? 2019 Saudi Journal of Gastroenterology.",Endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation; endoscopic sphincterotomy; hemodialysis; postprocedure bleeding,"adult; aged; Article; balloon dilatation; cohort analysis; controlled study; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; endoscopic sphincterotomy; female; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; hemodialysis patient; hemostasis; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; middle aged; postoperative hemorrhage; register; Taiwan; very elderly; bleeding; chronic kidney failure; comparative study; devices; dilatation; endoscopic sphincterotomy; gastrointestinal tract; hemodialysis; pathology; postoperative hemorrhage; procedures; retrospective study; standards; statistics and numerical data; vascularization; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cholangiopancreatography, Endoscopic Retrograde; Dilatation; Female; Gastrointestinal Tract; Hemorrhage; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Hemorrhage; Renal Dialysis; Retrospective Studies; Sphincterotomy, Endoscopic; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85063623022

A key factor that affects the precision and accuracy of blood tests is the interference of red blood cells; however, the conventional methods of blood separation are often complicated and time consuming. In this study, we devised a simple but high-efficiency blood separation system on a self-strained microfluidic device that separates 99.7 ± 0.3% of the plasma in only 6 min. Parameters, such as flow rate, design of the filter trench, and the relative positions of the filter trench and channel, were optimized through microscopic monitoring. Moreover, this air-difference-driven device uses a cost-effective and easy-to-use heater device that creates a low-pressure environment in the microchannel within minutes. With the aforementioned advantages, this blood separation device could be another platform choice for point-of-care testing. ? 2019 Yang et al.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). However, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is highly expressed in most of the TNBCs, which may provide a potential target for EGFR targeting therapy. Nanodiamond (ND) is a carbon-based nanomaterial with several advantages, including fluorescence emission, biocompatibility, and drug delivery applications. In this study, we designed a nanocomposite by using ND conjugated with paclitaxel (PTX) and cetuximab (Cet) for targeting therapy on the EGFR-positive TNBC cells. ND-PTX inhibited cell viability and induced mitotic catastrophe in various human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and BT474); in contrast, ND alone did not induce cell death. ND-PTX inhibited the xenografted human breast tumors in nude mice. We further investigated ND-PTX-Cet drug efficacy on the TNBC of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. ND-PTX-Cet could specifically bind to EGFR and enhanced the anticancer effects including drug uptake levels, mitotic catastrophe, and apoptosis in the EGFR-expressed MDA-MB-231 cells but not in the EGFR-negative MCF-7 cells. In addition, ND-PTX-Cet increased the protein levels of active caspase-3 and phospho-histone H3 (Ser10). Furthermore, ND-PTX-Cet showed more effective on the reduction of TNBC tumor volume by comparison with ND-PTX. Taken together, these results demonstrated that ND-PTX-Cet nanocomposite enhanced mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis by targeting EGFR of TNBC cells, which can provide a feasible strategy for TNBC therapy. Statement of significance: Current TNBC treatment is ineffective against the survival rate of TNBC patients. Therefore, the development of new treatment strategies for TNBC patients is urgently needed. Here, we have designed a nanocomposite by targeting on the EGFR of TNBC to enhance therapeutic efficacy by ND-conjugated PTX and Cet (ND-PTX-Cet). Interestingly, we found that the co-delivery of Cet and PTX by ND enhanced the apoptosis, mitotic catastrophe and tumor inhibition in the EGFR-expressed TNBC in vitro and in vivo. Consequently, this nanocomposite ND-PTX-Cet can be applied for targeting EGFR of human TNBC therapy. ? 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.",Cetuximab; EGFR; Nanodiamond; Paclitaxel; Triple-negative breast cancer,caspase 3; cetuximab; epidermal growth factor receptor; histone H3; nanocomposite; nanodiamond; paclitaxel; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; binding affinity; BT-474 cell line; cancer inhibition; controlled study; drug conjugation; drug efficacy; drug receptor binding; drug uptake; human; human cell; male; MCF-7 cell line; MDA-MB-231 cell line; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein targeting; triple negative breast cancer,2-s2.0-85060354464

In this study, spiking tests of SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells were used for the evaluation of capture efficiency. Then, peripheral bloods from 14 pregnant women whose fetuses have evidenced non-maternal genomic markers (e.g., de novo pathogenic copy number changes) were tested for the capture of circulating fetal nucleated red blood cells (fnRBCs). Captured cells were subjected to fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on chip or recovered by an automated cell picker for molecular genetic analyses. The capture rate for the spiking tests is estimated as 88.1%. For the prenatal study, 2-71 fnRBCs were successfully captured from 2 mL of maternal blood in all pregnant women.

If a UAV does not move, the coordinates of objects in images can be considered as reference for predicting parameters such as distance and direction. How-ever, this does not apply if the UAV is moving. In this research, methods of image processing are used to obtain the pinhole model which is similar to perpendicularly taken images, which should be distance-preserving. Then, the method of image stitching is used to find out the correlation of relative position between each image in order to construct a global coordinates system over every images. The common used methods of image stitching are not considered about distance-preserving, and cause the cumulative error usually. In this case, GPS information is used to estimate the starting position of images, then stitching those images to a panorama through applying SIFT feature pair and fine-tuning by the gradient method. At last, this paper integrates methods as mentioned into implementation and presents visualized data, then both the trajectory of UAV and the relative position of objects between images and the panorama can be observed by user in order to verify feasibility and precision of methods.

LPPC can be easily loaded with an anti-tumor drug and non-covalently associated with an anti-tumor antibody such as Herceptin that is clinically used to rapidly form immunoparticles within 1 h. Results: Drug-loaded LPPC have an average size about 250 nm and a zeta potential of about 40 mV. Herceptin was complexed onto surface of the LPPC to form the drug/LPPC/Herceptin complexes. The size of curcumin/LPPC/Herceptin complexes were 280 nm and the zeta potentials were about 23 mV. Targeting ability of this delivery system was demonstrated through specific binding on surface of cells and IVIS images in vivo, which showed specific binding in HER2-positive SKBR3 cells as compared to HER2-negative Hs578T cells. Only the drug/LPPC/Herceptin complexes displayed dramatically increased the cytotoxic activity in cancer cells. Both in vitro and in vivo results indicated that Herceptin adsorbed on LPPC directed the immunocomplex towards HER2/neu-positive cells but not HER2/neu-negative cells. The complexes with either component (curcumin or doxorubicin) used in the LPPC-delivery system provided a better therapeutic efficacy compared to the drug treatment alone and other treatment groups, including clinical dosages of Herceptin and LipoDox, in a xenografted model. Conclusions: LPPC displays important clinical implications by easily introducing a specific targeting characteristic to drugs utilized for breast cancer therapy. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Curcumin; Doxorubicin; Drug delivery; Herceptin; Lipo-PEG-PEI complex,"Antibodies; Cells; Controlled drug delivery; Cytology; Diseases; Drug delivery; Drug dosage; Liposomes; Tumors; Zeta potential; Breast cancer cells; Curcumin; Cytotoxic activities; Doxorubicin; Herceptin; Human epidermal growth factor; Lipo-peg-pei complexes; Therapeutic efficacy; Targeted drug delivery; curcumin; lipoplex; macrogol; polyethyleneimine; rituximab; trastuzumab; antineoplastic agent; curcumin; doxorubicin; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; liposome; macrogol; poly(ethylene glycol)-co-poly(ethyleneimine); polyethyleneimine; trastuzumab; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; Bagg albino mouse; BALB/c nude mouse; breast cancer; cancer inhibition; cancer survival; cell viability; controlled study; drug absorption; drug binding; drug clearance; drug cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug half life; drug megadose; drug structure; drug targeting; female; Hs 578T cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nanoencapsulation; NOD SCID mouse; nonhuman; particle size; SK-BR-3 cell line; tumor regression; tumor xenograft; zeta potential; analogs and derivatives; animal; breast tumor; cell proliferation; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; drug release; immunology; MCF-7 cell line; metabolism; pathology; surface property; xenograft; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Curcumin; Doxorubicin; Drug Liberation; Female; Heterografts; Humans; Liposomes; MCF-7 Cells; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Particle Size; Polyethylene Glycols; Polyethyleneimine; Receptor, ErbB-2; Surface Properties; Trastuzumab",2-s2.0-85061158642

However, mRNA transcripts and protein levels of DDX3X in patient specimens have shown the controversial correlations of DDX3X with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prevalence. In this study, generation of hepatocyte-specific Ddx3x-knockout mice revealed that loss of Ddx3x facilitates liver tumorigenesis. Loss of Ddx3x led to profound ductular reactions, cell apoptosis, and compensatory proliferation in female mutants at 6 weeks of age. The sustained phosphorylation of histone H2AX (γH2AX) and significant accumulation of DNA single-strand breaks and double-strand breaks in liver indicated that the replicative stress occurred in female mutants. Further chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that DDX3X bound to promoter regions and regulated the expression of DNA repair factors, DDB2 and XPA, to maintain genome stability. Loss of Ddx3x led to decreased levels of DNA repair factors, which contributed to an accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage, replication stress, and eventually, spontaneous liver tumors and DEN-induced HCCs in Alb-Cre/+;Ddx3x flox/flox mice. Implications: These data identify an important role of DDX3X in the regulation of DNA damage repair to protect against replication stress in liver and HCC development and progression. ? 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",,ddb2 protein; DEAD box helicase 3; DEAD box protein; histone H2AX; protein; transcription factor Sp1; unclassified drug; xeroderma pigmentosum group A protein; aged; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; carcinogenesis; cell death; cell proliferation; chromatin immunoprecipitation; chromosome segregation; controlled study; DNA damage; DNA repair; DNA replication; double stranded DNA break; down regulation; excision repair; female; gene deletion; gene knockout; genomic instability; in vitro study; inflammation; liver cell carcinoma; liver injury; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression level; protein phosphorylation; single stranded DNA break,2-s2.0-85060916578

Carotid duplex is an effective non-invasive ultrasound test which identifies stroke patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis who are candidates for preventative intervention to reduce the risk of recurrence. In patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis, reversed ophthalmic artery flow (ROAF) is often observed at the time of the carotid duplex scan. In this study, we investigated whether ROAF, denoting exhaustion of cerebral collateral flow in ischemic stroke patients affected mid-term functional outcomes following carotid artery stenting (CAS) procedures. In total, 144 consecutive patients with a first episode of ischemic stroke and subsequent CAS procedure conducted between January 2010 and November 2014 at Changhua Christian Hospital, Taiwan were included. Clinical data were obtained by medical record review. Disability was assessed at two time points by utilising the Barthel Index (BI) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) before CAS and 12 months post-CAS. Among 85 patients presenting without ROAF, 48/85 (56.4%) had improved mRS scores following stenting. The condition remained unchanged (stationary) in 36/85 (43.5%) patients after stenting and one patient exhibited deteriorated condition 1/85(1.1%). In contrast, among the 59 patients presenting with ROAF, 24/59 (40.6%) had improved mRS score following stenting. The condition remained unchanged (stationary) in the remaining 35/59 (59.3%) patients after stenting, and no patient exhibited deteriorated condition 0/59 (0 %). This study provides evidence that CAS is a valid and effective treatment option regardless of whether patients exhibited ROAF or not. Patients without ROAF were significantly more likely to have improved mid-term functional outcomes compared to those with ROAF. In the group without ROAF admission, CRP may play a role in predicting subsequent functional outcomes, whereas admission Barthel Index was a predictor of outcome in the ROAF group. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Barthel Index; C-reactive protein; carotid duplex; Ischemic stroke; modified Rankin scale; ophthalmic artery,C reactive protein; glycosylated hemoglobin; high density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein; adult; age; aged; artery blood flow; Article; Barthel index; body mass; brain blood vessel; brain blood volume; brain ischemia; carotid artery obstruction; carotid artery stenting; clinical outcome; collateral circulation; computed tomographic angiography; controlled study; diffusion weighted imaging; digital subtraction angiography; echocardiography; female; human; major clinical study; male; mean transit time; medical record review; middle aged; ophthalmic artery; Rankin scale; recurrence risk; retrospective study; reversed ophthalmic artery flow; brain circulation; brain ischemia; carotid artery obstruction; cerebrovascular accident; complication; diagnostic imaging; endovascular surgery; neuroimaging; ophthalmic artery; outcome assessment; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; prognosis; severity of illness index; stent; Brain Ischemia; Carotid Stenosis; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Collateral Circulation; Endovascular Procedures; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging; Ophthalmic Artery; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Prognosis; Severity of Illness Index; Stents; Stroke,2-s2.0-85057533650

The occurrence of psychiatric disorders and Cox regression model measured adjusted HRs (aHR) were monitored until the end of 2013. The overall incidence of psychiatric disorders was 41.7% higher in the exposed group with OAB than in the non-exposed group without OAB (14.2% vs 10.1%, p<0.001), with an aHR of 1.34 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.80, p<0.001) for the OAB cohort.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective study to identify the characteristics of the elderly aged ?65 years with a comparison group aged 18–64 years among patients with scrub typhus, murine typhus, or acute Q fever who were serologically confirmed at three hospitals in Taiwan during 2002–2011. Results: Among 441 cases, including 187 cases of scrub typhus, 166 acute Q fever, and 88 murine typhus, 68 (15.4%) cases were elderly patients. The elderly had a higher severe complication rate (10.3% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.022), but did not have a significantly higher mortality rate (1.47% vs. 0.54%, p = 0.396). Compared with those without severe complications, we found the elderly (p = 0.022), dyspnea (p = 0.006), less relative bradycardia (p = 0.004), less febrile illness (p = 0.004), prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (p = 0.002), higher levels of initial C-reactive protein (p = 0.039), blood leukocyte counts (p = 0.01), and lower platelet counts (p = 0.012) are significantly associated with severe complications. Only prolonged prothrombin time was associated with severe complications in multivariate analysis (p = 0.018, CI 95% 0.01–0.66). Among clinical symptoms and laboratory data, multivariate analysis revealed chills was less frequently occurred in the elderly (p = 0.012, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33–9.99). Conclusion: The elderly cases with scrub typhus, murine typhus, or acute Q fever would be more likely to have severe complications, for which prothrombin time prolongation is an important predictor for severe complications. ? 2017",Acute Q fever; Complications; Elderly; Murine typhus; Scrub typhus,"alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; aspartate aminotransferase; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; C reactive protein; lactate dehydrogenase; activated partial thromboplastin time; acute kidney failure; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; arthralgia; Article; bradycardia; chill; controlled study; coughing; diarrhea; disease severity; disseminated intravascular clotting; dizziness; dyspnea; female; fever; geriatric patient; headache; human; leukocyte count; lymphadenopathy; major clinical study; male; meningitis; middle aged; murine typhus; pancreatitis; platelet count; prothrombin time; Q fever; retrospective study; rhinorrhea; scrub typhus; septic shock; sputum; Taiwan; clinical trial; complication; multicenter study; murine typhus; pathophysiology; prothrombin time; Q fever; scrub typhus; severity of illness index; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Prothrombin Time; Q Fever; Retrospective Studies; Scrub Typhus; Severity of Illness Index; Taiwan; Typhus, Endemic Flea-Borne",2-s2.0-85021927793

The values of n:m CFC between each pair of delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequencies were estimated from eye-open resting-state MEG data. The topographic maps of CFC values between alpha and other frequencies were illustrated. The results of simulation data showed the increased accuracy of phase and n:m CFC estimation for balanced power of two targeted frequencies. Results of MEG data exhibited that CFC maps of low-alpha activity presented broadly distributed coupling with high frequencies (including beta and gamma) in the frontal regions of salient-ventral attention and frontoparietal control networks, whereas high-alpha activity coupling with the gamma band in the posterior part of frontoparietal control network.

This research aims to develop and characterize an argon-based non-thermal atmospheric-pressure plasma jet (APPJ) with an application of sterilization and nail disease treatment. We characterized the electric properties by an electrical measurement system and quantified the active species in APPJ by optical emission spectroscopy (OES). The gas temperature of plasma jet is below 37°C, which is generally free of thermal damage for the human body. The results of OES measurement indicate that this APPJ has a high intensity of hydroxyl radicals (OH?), which has shown promise in killing microorganisms. The preliminary result from inactivation experiments also show that APPJ efficiently kills bacteria (P. aeruginosa) and yeast (C. albicans). Furthermore, we used bovine hoof as a surrogate model for human nails for penetration tests. The results demonstrated that argon APPJ is good in inhibition of P. aeruginosa (90% in 5 min) and C. albicans (76% in 5 min) on agar plates. In addition, antimicrobial tests showed that approximately 2-log and 4-log reduction can be reached for P. aeruginosa and C. albicans in 5 min, respectively, when the argon APPJ was applied with them deposited at the back of the bovine hoof. We attribute the latter which contradicts with the former may be caused by many possible factors, which include the biofilm formation of the P. aeruginosa on the bovine hoof, the nature and the size difference of these two pathogens. ? 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,agar; hydroxyl radical; animal experiment; Article; bovine; Candida albicans; green nail syndrome; hoof and claw; human; low level laser therapy; nail disease; nonhuman; optical emission spectroscopy; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; scanning electron microscopy; spectroscopy; temperature,2-s2.0-85065320297

Taking note of the typical pose of l-iduronic acid, we conceived of per-O-sulfonated analogues of such disaccharides, and devised a single-step procedure for per-O-sulfonation of unprotected sugars with concomitant 1,6-anhydro bridge formation to achieve such compounds through direct use of SO 3 ?Et 3 N as sulfonation reagent and dimethylformamide as solvent.

Many exoskeleton control systems detect users' intention by directly sensing their biological signals such as EMG, EEG, force, etc. Therefore, additional sensors are required, resulting in high cost and inconvenience of putting on and taking off the exoskeleton. In this paper, the user's intention is detected by estimating the torque exerted by the user based on exoskeleton dynamics as well as the current and angle of each joint motor; hence, requirements of sensors are diminished. Moreover, we conduct compliance control by modifying joint velocity commands according to the estimated torque and predefined mechanical admittance of each joint.

Drowsy driving is one of the main factors to the occurrence of traffic accident. Since drivers themselves may not always immediately recognize that they are in the drowsy state, the risk of traffic accident increases while the driver is in the low vigilance state. In order to address this problem, the estimation of drowsy driving state via brain-computer interfaces (BCI) becomes a major concern in the driving safety field. This study transforms the measured EEG record into a image-liked feature maps, and then passes these feature maps to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn the discriminative representations.

Obesity linked long-standing diabetes was established as a crucial event in cancer development. The recent findings improved that betatrophin, regulates lipid and glucose metabolism. However, the potential function of betatrophin activity in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to metabolic syndrome is not fully understood. This preliminary study aimed to elucidate the fundamental role of betatrophin in HCC linked metabolic syndrome. This study was conducted by in vivo model by using miR-122a-/- mouse induced by a high-fat diet. The alteration of liver betatrophin expression was confirmed by RT-qPCR method, while the histological section examination was done to observe the change of liver anatomy. Importantly, our study found that diet-induced obesity (DIO) was able to accelerate metabolic syndrome. The long-term treatment of DIO exacerbate portal inflammation, fatty liver and liver fibrosis accelerate liver tumorigenesis or precancer symptoms. The expression of betatrophin significantly increased in our metabolic syndrome mouse model indicate the involvement of betatrophin in lipid metabolism disorder to induce liver injury and hepatoma.

The clinical management of both ATC and STC is very similar because they are not particularly responsive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This inspired us to explore a novel and effective clinically approved therapy for ATC treatment. Histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) drugs are recently FDA-approved drug for malignancies, especially for blood cell cancers. Therefore, we investigated whether an HDACi drug acts as an effective anticancer drug for advanced thyroid cancers. Cell viability analysis of panobinostat treatment demonstrated a significant IC50 of 0.075 ?M on SW579 STC cells. In addition, panobinostat exposure activated histone acetylation and triggered cell death mainly through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis-related protein activation. Using CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out HDAC1 and HDAC2 genes in SW579 cells, we observed that the histone acetylation level and cell cycle arrest were enhanced without any impact on cell growth. Furthermore, HDAC1 and HDAC2 double knockout (KO) cells showed dramatic cell apoptosis activation compared to HDAC1 and HDAC2 individual KO cells. This suggests expressional and biofunctional compensation between HDAC1 and HDAC2 on SW579 cells. This study provides strong evidence that panobinostat can potentially be used in the clinic of advanced thyroid cancer patients. ? 2019 by the authors.

The development of a direct and effective technique for the rapid detection and screening of 4-NP is, therefore, of urgent need. In this study, the blue luminescent sulfur-doped graphene quantum dots (S-GQDs) with a size of 1-5 nm are fabricated using a one-step pyrolysis procedure in the presence of citric acid and 3-mercaptosuccinic acid. The S-GQDs exhibit a strong emission band at 450 nm under the excitation of 330 nm UV light. 4-NP can serve as the fluorescence quencher by the π-π interaction with S-GQD, resulting in the linear decrease in fluorescence intensity after the addition of various 4-NP concentrations ranging from 10 nM to 200 μM. The S-GQDs serve as the sensing probe to enhance the analytical performance on 4-NP detection with the limit of detection values of 0.7 and 3.5 nM in deionized water and wastewater, respectively. The S-GQD based sensing platform can be used to detect 4-NP in different matrices of water and wastewater. In addition, the detected percentages of spiked 4-NP concentrations in the presence of different matrices and interferences are in the range of (98 ± 5)-(108 ± 2)%. Moreover, the S-GQD based paper sensor can rapidly screen 4-NP in wastewater within 1 min.

Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: Hearing thresholds were measured at baseline (2005–2008) and 5- (2010–2013) and 10-year (2015–2017) follow-up examinations. HI was defined as a pure-tone average &gt;25 dB HL in either ear. BOSS participants free of HI at baseline with at least one follow-up examination (N = 2,065) were included. Potential risk factors evaluated included cardiovascular measures, health history, lifestyle factors, inflammatory markers, vitamins D and B12, lead, and cadmium. Results: Participants were 21 to 79 years (mean age = 47.9 years) at baseline. The 10-year cumulative HI incidence was 17.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.7–19.2) and was twice as likely in men (24.4%, 95% CI: 21.5–27.7) than in women (12.2%, 95% CI: 10.3–14.3). In a multivariable adjusted model, age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.38–1.59, per 5 years), male sex (HR = 2.47, 95% CI: 1.91–3.18), less than a college education (HR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.02–1.79), body mass index (HR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01–1.05, per kg/m2), and higher cadmium levels (HR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.05–1.92, quintile 5 vs. quintiles 1–4) were associated with the 10-year cumulative incidence of HI. There was no association between high lead levels, vitamins D or B12, and 10-year incidence of HI. Conclusions: In addition to age and sex, obesity, education, and blood cadmium levels were associated with increased incidence of HI. These prospective results add to evidence that age-related HI is a multifactorial preventable disorder.

The current study aimed to address whether RBV enhanced early viral kinetics in patients with DAAs. Methods: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype-1b patients were allocated to daclatasvir/asunaprevir +weight-based RBV (1000–1200?mg/day) for 12–24?weeks. HCV RNA levels were compared at day 1, week 1, week 2, and week 4 of treatment. Results: The sustained virological response rate was 100% (67/67) and 96.7% (59/61) in the RBV and non-RBV group, respectively. The HCV RNA levels at treatment week 2 (W2) were significantly lower in the RBV group than in the non-RBV group (0.42?±?0.81 log IU/mL vs 0.79?±?1.03 log IU/mL, P?=?0.04). Among the intermediate responders who remained to have detectable RNA after W1 of treatment, patients with RBV had a significantly higher rate of undetectable HCV RNA (71.4% vs 36.0%, P?=?0.003) and lower HCV RNA level at W2 (0.55?±?0.89 log IU/mL vs 1.32?±?1.04 log IU/mL, P?=?0.001). A more significant magnitude of HCV RNA reduction was also noted from baseline to day 1 (3.15?±?0.38 log IU/mL vs 2.80?±?0.70 log IU/mL, P?=?0.009) and W1 to W2 (1.40?±?0.65 log IU/mL vs 0.88?±?0.78 log IU/mL, P?=?0.007) in the RBV group compared to the non-RBV group among the intermediate responders. Logistic regression analysis revealed that adding RBV independently predicted undetectable HCV RNA at W2 (odds ratio/confidence interval: 4.74/1.54–14.57, P?=?0.007) in the intermediate responders.

Here we present a highly simple, rapid, and cost-effective liquid biopsy for ex vivo drug-susceptibility testing of leukemia. The method is based on an extreme-throughput (>1 million cells per second), label-free, whole-blood imaging flow cytometer with a deep convolutional autoencoder, enabling image-based identification of the drug susceptibility of every single white blood cell in whole blood within 24 hours by simply flowing a drug-treated whole blood sample as little as 500 μL into the imaging flow cytometer without labeling. Our results show that the method accurately evaluates the drug susceptibility of white blood cells from untreated patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

The DMN involved the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), left inferior parietal lobe (IPLL), right inferior parietal lobe (IPLR), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) subregions for all participants inboth the MT and TC groups. Compared with MT, TC had an increased functional connectivity in IPLL-IPLR and IPLR-PCC and decreased functional connectivity in mPFC-IPLL and IPLL-PCC. Both groups exhibited no significant difference in the regional rs-fMRI metric [i.e., amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF)]. In the analysis of the neural correlates for decision-making performance, risk adjustment was positively associated with ALFF in IPLL for all participants considering the group effects.

Various cancer treatments such as chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy are available for the cure but those are generally associated with poor long-term survival rates. Consequently, more advanced and selective methods that have better outcomes, fewer side effects, and high efficacies are highly in demand. Among these is the use of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) which act as an innovative kit for battling cancer. Low cost, magnetic properties and toxicity properties enable SPIONs to be widely utilized in biomedical applications. For example, magnetite and maghemite (Fe3O4 and γ-Fe2O3) exhibit superparamagnetic properties and are widely used in drug delivery, diagnosis, and therapy. These materials are termed SPIONs when their size is smaller than 20 nm. This review article aims to provide a brief introduction on SPIONs, focusing on their fundamental magnetism and biological applications.

Apart from the clinical trials, more HCC patients are currently being treated in daily practice, given that these treatments are highly effective and involve well-tolerated regimens. Large scale, real-world studies have demonstrated potentially suboptimal antiviral treatment efficacy in HCC patients who received DAAs. It is postulated that the impairment of the bioavailability of DAAs may account for the inferior treatment response. However, the results could not be generalized across all studies. The differing results were attributed to diverse patient characteristics, suboptimal regimens or imprecise definitions of active cancer statuses at the time of treatment initiation.

Cancer cells often use the maneuverability conferred by AS to produce proteins that contribute to growth and survival. In our previous studies, we identified that amiloride modulates AS in cancer cells. However, the effective concentration of amiloride required to modulate AS is too high for use in cancer treatment. In this study, we used computational algorithms to screen potential amiloride derivatives for their ability to regulate AS in cancer cells. We found that 3,5-diamino-6-chloro-N-(N-(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)carbamimidoyl)pyrazine-2-carboxamide (BS008) can regulate AS of apoptotic gene transcripts, including HIPK3, SMAC, and BCL-X, at a lower concentration than amiloride. This splicing regulation involved various splicing factors, and it was accompanied by a change in the phosphorylation state of serine/arginine-rich proteins (SR proteins). RNA sequencing was performed to reveal that AS of many other apoptotic gene transcripts, such as AATF, ATM, AIFM1, NFKB1, and API5, was also modulated by BS008. In?vivo experiments further indicated that treatment of tumor-bearing mice with BS008 resulted in a marked decrease in tumor size. BS008 also had inhibitory effects in?vitro, either alone or in a synergistic combination with the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents sorafenib and nilotinib. BS008 enabled sorafenib dose reduction without compromising antitumor activity. These findings suggest that BS008 may possess therapeutic potential for cancer treatment. ? 2019 The Authors.

Seed evidence could be grouped into several categories based on the types of crimes they are associated with, including child abuse, homicides and drugs. Most commonly, seeds are examined microscopically and identified to the plant species level to show a linkage between persons and places. More recently, forensic researchers have evaluated the potential for extracting and typing DNA from seeds to further individualize the samples. As a model system, tomato seeds were examined microscopically after different cooking treatments and assessed for the potential to DNA type seeds for variety identification. A sufficient quantity and quality of DNA were recovered from uncooked, digested and undigested tomato seeds for amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis; however, any form of cooking destroyed the seed DNA. A simple microscopic analysis was able to distinguish between a cooked tomato seed versus an uncooked seed.

Our recent study demonstrated that ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RPIA), a key regulator of the PPP, regulates hepatoma cell proliferation and colony formation. Our studies in zebrafish reveal that RPIA-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis requires extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and β-catenin signaling. To further investigate RPIA-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis, two independent lines of transgenic zebrafish expressing human RPIA in the liver were generated. These studies reveal that RPIA overexpression triggers lipogenic factor/enzyme expression, steatosis, fibrosis and proliferation of the liver. In addition, the severity of fibrosis and the extent of proliferation are positively correlated with RPIA expression levels. Furthermore, RPIA-mediated induction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) requires the ERK and β-catenin signaling pathway but is not dependent upon transaldolase levels. Our study presents a mechanism for RPIA-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis and suggests that RPIA represents a valuable therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC. ? 2019 The Author(s).",,beta catenin; isomerase; mitogen activated protein kinase; ribose 5 phosphate; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer growth; carcinogenesis; cell proliferation; comparative study; controlled study; enzyme activation; fatty liver; human; human cell; liver cell carcinoma; liver fibrosis; nonhuman; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; transgenic zebrafish; xenotransplantation,2-s2.0-85066817959

For people with hearing loss, communicating with other people, particularly in an environment with considerable background noise, is difficult. Recently, several hearing aids have been developed to improve speech comprehension in a noisy environment. The use of an adaptive beamformer is one of the alternative methods for improving speech intelligibility. However, the adaptive beamformer requires the location of the desired speaker to estimate the time differences of arrival (TDOAs) of speech sources to numerous spatially separated sensors in acoustics. In general, the technique of steered response power source localization was used to estimate the TDOA; however, this technique was easily affected by environmental reverberation. To overcome the aforementioned concern, a novel hearing aid is proposed in this paper. By using an image processing technology, the location of the desired speaker could be manually selected to provide precise information on the TDOA. Moreover, adaptive signal enhancements were implemented in a field-programmable gate array to enhance the speech of interest in real time.

One key factor for product commercialization is determining the optimal materials that allow for integration of excellent UV-sensing properties with compatibility with industrial fabrication processes. However, current UV sensors often fail to achieve this due to either mismatched materials or a device that must be excessively large in order to produce enough photocurrent for UV detection. The UV-light-sensing properties of an amorphous InGaZnO4 (IGZO) thin-film transistor with a dual-gate structure and relatively small device size (width/length = 50 ?m/10 ?m) that achieves high sensitivity through a threshold-voltage-(Vth)-adjustment method is proposed. Comparing the drain currents under UV exposure to those under darkened conditions indicates that the ratio between the photoinduced and dark current reaches 106. Furthermore, the UV sensitivity of the dual-gate transistors can be adjusted by varying the bottom gate voltage, with each pixel of the sensor then being read out separately via scan line pulses. This allows the dual-gate a-IGZO transistor to be used for high-performance UV sensing while being effectively integrated in display applications. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In addition, heart rate (HR) is one of the most important indicators of human's health status. When detecting the driver's HR, using traditional contact-type devices might bring about the driver's distraction or discomfort. On the contrary, the remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technique is a better way to monitor a driver's HR in vehicle applications simply by using a web-camera without interfering the driver. Most of the rPPG studies intended to reduce the interference caused by facial motion or luminance changes in the indoor or controlled scenario, but there are relatively fewer discussions on outdoor scenarios. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to enhance the rPPG technique to make it suitable for the outdoor driving scenarios and for monitoring the driver's HR in different weather conditions, including daytime and nighttime. We first utilize artificial neural network (ANN) and train multiple personalized ANN models for each driver. For predicting the drivers' HR beat more precisely, we propose the approach, adaptive neural network model selection (ANNMS), which adaptively selects a personalized ANN model based on different noise conditions. Our algorithm eliminates the effect of noises caused by the variations of facial luminance in eight outdoor driving scenarios. The proposed driver's HR beat monitoring system has been evaluated against the state-of-the-art rPPG techniques that are Chrominance signal-based (CHRO) and k-nearest neighbors-based (kNN) algorithms. Compared with the CHRO and kNN algorithms, the ANNMS reduces the mean absolute error from 14.71 bpm (CHRO) and 9.91 (kNN) to 4.51 bpm (ANNMS) and enhances the success-rate-10, the probability in which the absolute error is below 10 bpm, from 44.1% (CHRO) and 56.3% (kNN) to 91.5% (ANNMS). ? 2013 IEEE.",Advanced driver assistance systems; artificial neural network; health and safety; heart rate monitoring; remote photoplethysmography; vehicle safety,Artificial heart; Automobile drivers; Driver training; Heart; Learning algorithms; Luminance; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Patient monitoring; Photoplethysmography; Safety engineering; Adaptive neural network models; Health and safety; Heart-rate monitoring; In-vehicle applications; Luminance variation; Mean absolute error; Physiological status; Vehicle safety; Advanced driver assistance systems,2-s2.0-85065902826

There is currently no effective therapeutic or preventive treatment for DENV infection. Methods: Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed that prostasin expression was decreased upon DENV infection. Prostasin expression levels were confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in patients with dengue fever and a DENV-infected mice model. Short hairpin RNA against EGFR and LY294002 were used to investigate the molecular mechanism. Results: Based on clinical studies, we first found relatively low expression of prostasin, a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored membrane protease, in blood samples from patients with dengue fever compared with healthy individuals and a high correlation of prostasin expression and DENV-2 RNA copy number. DENV infection significantly decreased prostasin RNA levels of in vivo and in vitro models. By contrast, exogenous expression of prostasin could protect ICR suckling mice from life-threatening DENV-2 infection. Mechanistic studies showed that inhibition of DENV propagation by prostasin was due to reducing expression of epithelial growth factor receptor, leading to suppression of the Akt/NF-κB-mediated cyclooxygenase-2 signaling pathway.

In both cases, the average lifetime of the NADH autofluorescence was shorter in cancer cells than in normal cells, indicating that the difference in metabolism between healthy and cancer cells might alter the level of coenzymes such as NADH.

The development of new drugs that block lymphangiogenesis represents a promising therapeutic strategy. Marine fungus-derived compound phomaketide A, isolated from the fermented broth of Phoma sp. NTOU4195, has been reported to exhibit anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory effects. However, its anti-lymphangiogenic activity has not been clarified to date. In this study, we showed that phomaketide A inhibited cell growth, migration, and tube formation of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) without an evidence of cytotoxicity. Mechanistic investigations revealed that phomaketide A reduced LECs-induced lymphangiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3), protein kinase C (PKC), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) signalings. Furthermore, human proteome array analysis indicated that phomaketide A significantly enhanced the protein levels of various protease inhibitors, including cystatin A, serpin B6, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), and tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1). Importantly, phomaketide A impeded tumor growth and lymphangiogenesis by decreasing the expression of LYVE-1, a specific marker for lymphatic vessels, in tumor xenograft animal model. These results suggest that phomaketide A may impair lymphangiogenesis by suppressing VEGFR-3, PKC, and eNOS signaling cascades, while simultaneously activating protease inhibitors in human LECs. We document for the first time that phomaketide A inhibits lymphangiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, which suggests that this natural product could potentially treat cancer metastasis. ? 2019 by the authors.",Lymphangiogenesis; Lymphatic endothelial cells; Phomaketide a; Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3,"antineoplastic agent; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; fungal extract; phomaketide A; protein kinase C delta; rapamycin; unclassified drug; vasculotropin receptor 3; angiogenesis inhibitor; antinematodal agent; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; FLT4 protein, human; NOS3 protein, human; polyketide; PRKCD protein, human; protein kinase C delta; vasculotropin receptor 3; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer inhibition; controlled study; drug identification; drug isolation; drug mechanism; drug structure; endothelium cell; human; human cell; lung adenocarcinoma; lymph vessel endothelium; lymphangiogenesis; male; metastasis inhibition; migration inhibition; mouse; nonhuman; Phoma; tumor vascularization; A-549 cell line; animal; aquatic species; Ascomycetes; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; drug screening; endothelium cell; isolation and purification; lymph node metastasis; lymph vessel; lymphangiogenesis; metabolism; neoplasm; nude mouse; pathology; signal transduction; A549 Cells; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Animals; Antinematodal Agents; Aquatic Organisms; Ascomycota; Endothelial Cells; Humans; Lymphangiogenesis; Lymphatic Metastasis; Lymphatic Vessels; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; Neoplasms; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III; Polyketides; Protein Kinase C-delta; Signal Transduction; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-85064406124

With the increasing use of carbapenems in clinical practice, the emergence of carbapenem-resistant pathogens now poses a great threat to human health. Currently, antibiotic options for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are very limited, with polymyxins, tigecycline, fosfomycin, and aminoglycosides as the mainstays of therapy. The need for new and effective anti-CRE therapies is urgent. Here, we describe the current understanding of issues related to CRE and review combination therapeutic strategies for CRE infections, including high-dose tigecycline, high-dose prolonged-infusion of carbapenem, and double carbapenem therapy. We also review the newly available antibiotics which have potential in the future treatment of CRE infections: ceftazidime/avibactam, which is active against KPC and OXA-48 producers; meropenem/vaborbactam, which is active against KPC producers; plazomicin, which is a next-generation aminoglycoside with in vitro activity against CRE; and eravacycline, which is a tetracycline class antibacterial with in vitro activity against CRE. Although direct evidence for CRE treatment is still lacking and the development of resistance is a concern, these new antibiotics provide additional therapeutic options for CRE infections. Finally, we review other potential anti-CRE antibiotics in development: imipenem/relebactam and cefiderocol. Currently, high-dose and combination strategies that may include the new β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors should be considered in severe CRE infections to maximize treatment success. In the future, when more treatment options are available, therapy for CRE infections should be individualized and based on molecular phenotypes of resistance, susceptibility profiles, disease severity, and patient characteristics.

We hypothesized that cytokines have an important role in fibrosis development in HCV infection. Methods: Data of 92 patients were analyzed retrospectively. Fluorescent Bead immunoassay was used to measure the following serum cytokine levels: Interferon γ, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-12. Various statistical analyses were used as appropriate. Results: Of the 92 HCV-infected patients, 49 (53.3%) were male, 23 (25%) patients had advanced (fibrosis grades 3-4) fibrosis, and the mean age of the study population was 51.9 ± 9.4 years. Elevation of baseline IL-4 level (&gt;490 pg/mL) was associated with liver fibrosis grade by χ2 test (odds ratio [OR] = 2.99; 95%, CI = 1.02-8.78; p = 0.042) and multivariate logistic regression (OR = 4.26; 95% CI = 1.13-16.02; p = 0.032). Also, IL-4 had strong diagnostic value in advanced liver fibrosis by using area under receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. Assessment of fibrosis score was consequently developed from our findings and compared with other noninvasive serum markers to assess liver fibrosis. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that increased IL-4 expression predicted advanced liver fibrosis in treatment of naive HCV-infected patients. The newly developed “FIL4” score had good predictive value for advanced fibrosis before treatment and this value was even strong in HCV-genotype 1b patients.

However, the long-term wearable ECGs can be significantly contaminated by various noises, which affect the detection and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The situation becomes more serious for wearable ECG screening, where the data are huge, and doctors have no way to visually check the signal quality episode-by-episode. Therefore, automatic and accurate noise rejection for the wearable big-data ECGs is craving. This paper addressed this issue and proposed a noise rejection method for wearable ECGs based on the combination of modified frequency slice wavelet transform (MFSWT) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Wearable ECGs were recorded using the newly developed 12-lead Lenovo smart ECG vest with a sample rate of 500 Hz and a resolution of 16 bit. One thousand 10-s ECG segments were picked up and were manually labeled into three quality types: clinically useful segments with good signal quality (type A), clinically useful segments with poor signal quality (type B), and clinically useless segments (pure noises, type C). Each of the 1,000 10-s ECG segments were transformed into a 2-D time-frequency (T-F) image using the MFSWT, with a pixel size of 200 × 50. Then, the 2-D grayscale images from MFSWT were fed into a 13-layer CNN model for training the classification models. Results from the standard 5-folder cross-validation showed that the proposed combination method of MFSWT and CNN achieved a highest classification accuracy of 86.3%, which was higher than the comparable methods from continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The combination of MFSWT and CNN also had a good calculation efficiency. This paper indicated that the combination of MFSWT and CNN is a potential method for automatic identification of noisy segments from wearable ECG recordings. ? 2013 IEEE.",convolutional neural network (CNN); modified frequency slice wavelet transform (MFSWT); signal quality assessment (SQA); Wearable ECG,Automation; Biomedical signal processing; Convolution; Data visualization; Electrocardiography; Neural networks; Wearable technology; Automatic identification; Cardio-vascular disease; Classification accuracy; Continuous wavelet transforms; Convolutional neural network; Frequency slice wavelet transforms; Signal quality assessment; Wearable ECG; Wavelet transforms,2-s2.0-85063865569

Over the last decade, different nanomaterials have been exploited to design highly efficient biosensors for the detection of analyte biomolecules. The discovery of graphene has spectacularly accelerated research on fabricating low-cost electrode materials because of its unique physical properties, including high specific surface area, high carrier mobility, high electrical conductivity, flexibility, and optical transparency. Graphene and its oxygenated derivatives, including graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), are becoming an important class of nanomaterials in the field of biosensors. The presence of oxygenated functional groups makes GO nanosheets strongly hydrophilic, facilitating chemical functionalization. Graphene, GO and rGO nanosheets can be easily combined with various types of inorganic nanoparticles, including metals, metal oxides, semiconducting nanoparticles, quantum dots, organic polymers and biomolecules, to create a diverse range of graphene-based nanocomposites with enhanced sensitivity for biosensor applications. This review summarizes the advances in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) graphene-based nanocomposites as emerging electrochemical and fluorescent biosensing platforms for the detection of a wide range of biomolecules with enhanced sensitivity, selectivity and a low limit of detection. The biofunctionalization and nanocomposite formation processes of graphene-based materials and their unique properties, surface functionalization, enzyme immobilization strategies, covalent immobilization, physical adsorption, biointeractions and direct electron transfer (DET) processes are discussed in connection with the design and fabrication of biosensors. The enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions on graphene-based nanocomposite surfaces for glucose- and cholesterol-related electrochemical biosensors are analyzed.

In this paper, based on non-visual parameters, such as the circadian action factor (CAF) and circadian illuminance, the circadian performance of smartphone-based VR displays is quantitatively evaluated by an evaluation system we designed. Moreover, we investigate the improvements in the circadian performance of VR headsets resulting from three practical methods for reducing the blue light content. Finally, a theoretical method of shifting the green-light wavelength of the screen close to 555 nm to optimize the CAF of VR headsets is proposed.

Since mEHT possesses the unique ability to excite cell membranes, we hypothesized that mEHT could enhance the uptake of liposomal drugs by enhancing phagocytic activity. Materials and methods: Water bath control and mEHT were used to compare the enhancement of liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin (Lipodox?) uptake by cancer cells. Cancer cells were made visible by doxorubicin fluorescence to investigate drug uptake. Viable cell yield was determined via the Trypan Blue exclusion method. Various substrates were used to investigate the mechanism of drug-uptake enhancement. The murine colon carcinoma model, CT26, was used to confirm the tissue infiltration of Lipodox? and its therapeutic effect. Results: mEHT treatment showed a significant enhancement of Lipodox? uptake of doxorubicin fluorescence compared with 37°C or 42°C water bath treatment. Tumor tissue sections also confirmed that mEHT treatment achieved the highest doxorubicin concentration in vivo (1.44±0.32 ?g/g in mEHT group and 0.79±0.32 ?g/g in 42°C water bath). Wortmannin was used to inhibit the macropinocytosis effect and 70 kDa dextran-FITC served as uptake substance. The uptake of dextran-FITC by cancer cells significantly increased after mEHT treatment whereas such enhancement was significantly inhibited by wortmannin. Conclusion: The result showed mEHT-induced particle-uptake through macropinocytosis. mEHT-enhanced uptake of Lipodox? may amplify the therapeutic effect of liposomal drugs. This novel finding warrants further clinical investigation. ? 2019 Tsang et al.",Cancer treatment; Doxorubicin; Hyperthermia; Liposome; Micropinocytosis,"doxorubicin; wortmannin; antineoplastic antibiotic; doxorubicin; macrogol; Article; cancer cell; cancer growth; colorectal carcinoma; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug potentiation; drug screening; drug uptake; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; liposomal delivery; macropinocytosis; modulated electro hyperthermia; outcome assessment; thermotherapy; A-549 cell line; analogs and derivatives; animal; apoptosis; Bagg albino mouse; cell membrane; cell survival; colon tumor; disease model; drug effect; Hep-G2 cell line; neoplasm; particle size; pathology; pinocytosis; signal transduction; A549 Cells; Animals; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Apoptosis; Cell Membrane; Cell Survival; Colonic Neoplasms; Disease Models, Animal; Doxorubicin; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Hyperthermia, Induced; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Neoplasms; Particle Size; Pinocytosis; Polyethylene Glycols; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-85062877284

However, current protein drugs are typically limited to acting on extracellular/cell membrane components associated with the diseases, while intracellular delivery of recombinant proteins replaces or replenishes faulty/missing proteins and remains inadequate. In this study, we developed a convenient and efficient intracellular protein delivery vehicle. Materials and methods: A cationic liposomal polyethylenimine and polyethylene glycol complex (LPPC) was developed to noncovalently capture proteins for protein transfer into cells via endocytosis. β-glucuronidase (βG) was used in vitro and in vivo as a model enzyme to demonstrate the enzymatic activity of the intracellular transport of a protein. Results: The endocytosed protein/LPPC complexes escaped from lysosomes, and the bound protein dissociated from LPPC in the cytosol. The enzymatic activity of βG was well preserved after intracellular delivery in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: Using LPPC as an intracellular protein transporter for protein therapeutics, we illustrated that LPPC may be an effective and convenient tool for studying diseases and developing therapeutics. ? 2019 Lin et al.",EGFP; Endocytosis; Enhanced green fluorescent protein; Intracellular protein delivery; Liposomal polyethylenimine and polyethylene glycol complex; LPPC; β-glucuronidase,"beta glucuronidase; bovine serum albumin; fluorescein isothiocyanate; liposome polyethylene glycol polyethyleneimine complex; polymer; unclassified drug; beta glucuronidase; enhanced green fluorescent protein; green fluorescent protein; liposome; macrogol; poly(ethylene glycol)-co-poly(ethyleneimine); polyethyleneimine; protein; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; cytosol; cytotoxicity; dissociation; drug activity; drug distribution; drug stability; drug tissue level; drug transport; endocytosis; female; in vitro study; in vivo study; lysosome; mouse; nonhuman; particle size; tissue distribution; zeta potential; 3T3 cell line; adsorption; analogs and derivatives; animal; Bagg albino mouse; bovine; cell death; chemistry; fluorescence; Hep-G2 cell line; human; intracellular space; metabolism; protein stability; static electricity; 3T3 Cells; Adsorption; Animals; Cattle; Cell Death; Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate; Fluorescence; Glucuronidase; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Intracellular Space; Liposomes; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Particle Size; Polyethylene Glycols; Polyethyleneimine; Protein Stability; Proteins; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Static Electricity",2-s2.0-85062670795

Migration and infiltration of mononuclear cells into inflammatory sites are critical events during the development of osteoarthritis (OA). Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), also known as chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), plays a critical role in the regulation of monocyte migration and infiltration. In this study, we show how resistin promotes MCP-1 expression in OA synovial fibroblasts and monocyte migration. Methods: We used qPCR to detect MCP-1 and miRNA expression. THP-1 migration was investigated by Transwell assay. The Western blotting was used to examine the resistin-mediated signaling pathways. Results: Resistin activated the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways, while PI3K, Akt and mTOR inhibitors or small interfering RNAs diminished resistin-induced MCP-1 expression and monocyte migration. We also demonstrate that resistin stimulates MCP-1mediated monocyte migration by suppressing microRNA (miR)-33a and miR-33b via the PI3K, Akt and mTOR signaling pathways. Conclusion: These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of resistin action that may have therapeutic implications for patients with OA. ? 2019 The Author(s).",MCP-1; Monocyte migration; Osteoarthritis; Resistin,"monocyte chemotactic protein 1; resistin; antagomir; microRNA; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; MTOR protein, human; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; recombinant protein; resistin; small interfering RNA; target of rapamycin kinase; Akt signaling; Article; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell survival; chemoluminescence; chemotaxis assay; controlled study; down regulation; fibroblast; gene expression regulation; human; human cell; monocyte; priority journal; protein analysis; protein expression; protein function; protein phosphorylation; protein synthesis; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; synovial fluid; synovium; upregulation; Western blotting; 3' untranslated region; antagonists and inhibitors; biosynthesis; cell culture; cell motion; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; fibroblast; gene expression; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; monocyte; osteoarthritis; pathology; RNA interference; signal transduction; synovium; 3' Untranslated Regions; Antagomirs; Cell Movement; Cells, Cultured; Chemokine CCL2; Fibroblasts; Gene Expression; Humans; MicroRNAs; Monocytes; Osteoarthritis; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Recombinant Proteins; Resistin; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering; Signal Transduction; Synovial Membrane; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases",2-s2.0-85062610502

Methods: In this study, the population-based National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan was used to identify patients in whom OSA had been frst diagnosed between 2000 and 2015. Children and adolescents with OSA (n = 6,535) were included with 1:3 ratio by age, sex, and index year of control participants without OSA (n = 19,605). The Cox proportional regression model was used to evaluate the risk of MACEs in this cohort study. Results: After a 15-year follow-up, the incidence rate of MACEs was higher in the OSA cohort when compared with the non-OSA control cohort (15.97 and 8.20 per 100,000 person-years, respectively). After adjusting for covariates, the risk of MACEs among children and adolescents with OSA was still signifcantly higher (hazard ratio = 2.050; 95% confdence interval = 1.312 3.107; P = .010). No MACEs were found in the children and adolescents with OSA who received continuous airway positive pressure treatment or pharyngeal surgery. Conclusions: This study found a signifcantly higher risk of MACEs in children and adolescents with OSA. These fndings strongly suggest that clinicians should provide careful follow-up and medical treatment for children and adolescents with OSA. ? 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

One of the crucial applications is a ubiquitous clinic recommendation system, which entails recommending a suitable clinic to a mobile patient based on his/her location, hospital department, and preferences. However, patients may not be willing or able to express their preferences. To overcome this problem, some ubiquitous clinic recommendation systems mine the historical data of patients to learn their preferences, and they apply an algorithm to adjust the recommendation algorithm after receiving more patient data. Such an adjustment mechanism may operate for several periods; however, this raises a question regarding the sustainability (i.e., long-term effectiveness) of such an adjustment mechanism. To address this question, this study modeled the improvement in the successful recommendation rate of a ubiquitous clinic recommendation system that adopts an adjustment mechanism as a learning process. Both the asymptotic value and learning speed of the learning process provide valuable information regarding the long-term effectiveness of the adjustment mechanism. The proposed methodology was applied in a regional study to a ubiquitous clinic recommendation system that adjusts the recommendation mechanism by solving an integer nonlinear programming problem on a rolling basis. The experimental results revealed that the proposed method exhibited a considerably higher level of accuracy in forecasting the successful recommendation rate compared with several existing methods. Although the adjustment mechanism exhibits long-term effectiveness, the learning speed requires improvement. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Learning; Successful recommendation rate; Sustainable; Ubiquitous clinic recommendation,adult; article; comparative effectiveness; forecasting; human; learning; patient coding; velocity,2-s2.0-85061591823

This study examined the effectiveness of various vaccine policies against influenza. The transmission rate was calculated by use of the time-series influenza-like illness case during the year of 2009 and recent epidemics in Taiwan. Methods. We developed a stochastic compartmental model to analyze the transmission of influenza, where the population was stratified by location and age group, and the vaccine distribution was considered using the current policy. The simulation study compared the previous vaccine policy and a new policy with expanded coverage and various lengths of the vaccination campaign. The sensitivity analysis investigated different levels of vaccine efficacy to confirm the robustness of the recommended policies. Results. Doubling vaccine coverage can decrease the number of infections effectively in the regular epidemic scenario. However, a peak of infections occurs if the duration of implementing vaccination is too long. In the 2009-like pandemic scenario, both increasing vaccine doses and reducing the program's duration can mitigate infections, although the early outbreak restricts the effectiveness of vaccination programs. Conclusions. The finding indicates that only increasing vaccine coverage can reduce influenza infections. To avoid the peak of infections, it is also necessary to execute the vaccination activity immediately. Vaccine efficacy significantly impacts the vaccination policy's performance. When vaccine efficacy is low, neither increasing vaccination doses nor reducing vaccination timeframe prevents infections. Therefore, the variation in vaccine efficacy should be taken into account when making immunization policies against influenza. ? 2019 Chen et al.",Disease model; Influenza; Simulation; Vaccine policy,influenza vaccine; 2009 H1N1 influenza; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; disease model; disease surveillance; disease transmission; drug efficacy; epidemic; human; infant; infection prevention; infection rate; influenza; influenza vaccination; mathematical model; mortality rate; pandemic; sensitivity analysis; simulation; treatment duration; vaccination; vaccination coverage; validation process,2-s2.0-85061405134

This present study incorporated multiple structural and functional connectivity metrics into a graph theoretical analysis framework and investigated alterations in brain network topology in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. By using this multiparametric analysis, we expected different connectivity metrics may reflect additional or complementary information regarding the topological changes in brain networks in MCI or AD. In our study, a total of 73 subjects participated in this study and underwent the magnetic resonance imaging scans. For the structural network, we compared commonly used connectivity metrics, including fractional anisotropy and normalized streamline count, with multiple diffusivity-based metrics. We compared Pearson correlation and covariance by investigating their sensitivities to functional network topology. Significant disruption of structural network topology in MCI and AD was found predominantly in regions within the limbic system, prefrontal and occipital regions, in addition to widespread alterations of local efficiency. At a global scale, our results showed that the disruption of the structural network was consistent across different edge definitions and global network metrics from the MCI to AD stages. Significant changes in connectivity and tract-specific diffusivity were also found in several limbic connections. Our findings suggest that tract-specific metrics (e.g., fractional anisotropy and diffusivity) provide more sensitive and interpretable measurements than does metrics based on streamline count. Besides, the use of inversed radial diffusivity provided additional information for understanding alterations in network topology caused by AD progression and its possible origins. Use of this proposed multiparametric network analysis framework may facilitate early MCI diagnosis and AD prevention. ? 2019 The Authors",Alzheimer's disease; Brain network; Diffusion tensor imaging; Functional connectivity; Graph theoretical analysis; Mild cognitive impairment; Resting-state functional MRI; Structural connectivity,adult; Alzheimer disease; analytical parameters; Article; axial diffusivity; body mass; brain function; controlled study; diffusion weighted imaging; echo planar imaging; female; fractional anisotropy; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; human; limbic system; major clinical study; male; Markov chain; Mini Mental State Examination; Montreal cognitive assessment; multiparametric graph theoretical analysis; priority journal; radial diffusivity,2-s2.0-85060729622

One of the most important applications is point-of-care (POC) clinical diagnosis which is directly related to human health. However, biochemical experiments are usually error-prone, which makes monitoring intermediate results during bioassay execution be required to ensure the correctness of POC clinical diagnosis. To tackle this problem, cyber-physical digital microfluidic biochips with integrated sensors have been proposed and have attracted attention recently. In order to fully utilize the sensors for detection, the reusability of sensors should be taken into consideration during the module placement stage of cyber-physical DMFBs synthesis flow. Moreover, excessive actuation of electrodes may cause reliability degradation and this issuse should also be taken care of during module placement stage. In order to deal with the aforementioned problems, this paper presents the first co-optimization method for both module and sensor placement.

Materials and methods: Hydrophobic AuNRs were synthesized by the hexadecyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB)-mediated seed growth method, and then, they received two-step surface modifications of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dodecane. The AuNR/DOX/poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanocomplexes were prepared by emulsifying DOX, AuNR, and PLGA into aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solution by sonication. Human serum albumin (HSA) was used to coat the nanocomplexes to afford HSA/AuNR/DOX–PLGA (HADP). Size and surface potential of the HADP nanocomplexes were determined by using a Zetasizer. Cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of the HADP were analyzed by using MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. In vitro anticancer effects of the HADP were studied on various cancer cell lines. To assess the therapeutic efficacy, CT26 tumor-bearing mice were intravenously administered with HADP nanocomplexes and laser treatments, followed by monitoring of the tumor growth and body weight. Results: Size and surface potential of the HADP nanocomplexes were 245.8 nm and-8.6 mV, respectively. Strong photothermal effects were verified on the AuNR-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) in vitro. Rapid and repeated drug release from the HADP nanocomplexes was successfully achieved by near-infrared (NIR) irradiations. HSA significantly promoted cellular uptake of the HADP nanocomplexes to murine colon cancer cells as demonstrated by cell imaging and flow cytometric studies.

The objective of this study was to describe the advertising content of popular children's apps. Methods: To create a coding scheme, we downloaded and played 39 apps played by children aged 12 months to 5 years in a pilot study of a mobile sensing app; 2 researchers played each app, took detailed notes on the design of advertisements, and iteratively refined the codebook (interrater reliability 0.96). Codes were then applied to the 96 most downloaded free and paid apps in the 5 And Under category on the Google Play app store. Results: Of the 135 apps reviewed, 129 (95%) contained at least 1 type of advertising. These included use of commercial characters (42%); full-app teasers (46%); advertising videos interrupting play (e.g., pop-ups [35%] or to unlock play items [16%]); in-app purchases (30%); prompts to rate the app (28%) or share on social media (14%); distracting ads such as banners across the screen (17%) or hidden ads with misleading symbols such as ""$"" or camouflaged as gameplay items (7%). Advertising was significantly more prevalent in free apps (100% vs 88% of paid apps), but occurred at similar rates in apps labeled as ""educational"" versus other categories. Conclusion: In this exploratory study, we found high rates of mobile advertising through manipulative and disruptive methods. These results have implications for advertising regulation, parent media choices, and apps' educational value. Copyright ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, systemic, nondiscriminatory neutralization of TNF-α is associated with considerable adverse effects. Methods: Here, we developed a trimeric chimeric TNF receptor by linking an N-terminal mouse Acrp30 trimerization domain and an MMP-2/9 substrate sequence to the mouse extracellular domain of TNF receptor 2 followed by a C-terminal mouse tetranectin coiled-coil domain (mouse Acrp-MMP-TNFR-Tn). Results: Here, we show that the Acrp30 trimerization domain inhibited the binding activity of TNFR, possibly by closing the binding site of the trimeric receptor. Cleavage of the substrate sequence by MMP-9, an enzyme highly expressed in inflammatory sites, restored the binding activity of the mouse TNF receptor. We also constructed a recombinant human chimeric TNF receptor (human Acrp-MMP-TNFR-Tn) in which an MMP-13 substrate sequence was used to link the human Acrp and the human TNF receptor 2. Human Acrp-MMP-TNFR-Tn showed reduced binding activity, and MMP-13 digestion recovered its binding activity with TNF-α. Conclusion: Acrp-masked chimeric TNF receptors may be able to be used for inflammatory tissue-selective neutralization of TNF-α to reduce the adverse effects associated with systemic neutralization of TNF-α. ? 2018",Chimeric TNF receptor; Inflammation; Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP); Tumor necrosis factor-α/receptor (TNF-α/TNFR),adiponectin; chimeric protein; collagenase 3; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; tetranectin; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor receptor; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 2; amino terminal sequence; animal tissue; Article; binding affinity; binding site; carboxy terminal sequence; chemical modification; controlled study; extracellular matrix; inflammation; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; protein cleavage; protein expression; protein folding; protein purification; protein structure; trimerization,2-s2.0-85055117606

And driver scheduling has long been suspected as the root cause affecting sleepiness and fatigue. As such, a fundamental question for intercity bus carriers is how to reduce crashes associated with driver schedules, while maintaining a nonstop service? This research seeks to develop a paradigm to minimize overall fleet crash risk by rescheduling. In this study, we first identified those driving schedules associated with the highest crash risks, and a rescheduling scheme is then proposed to reduce fleet crashes overall. A case-study approach was employed to identify driver scheduling associated with higher crash risk, and a mathematical program was then formulated to minimize fleet crash risk. Our results showed that several types of driver schedules would lead to higher crash risk; for example: (1) working in the afternoon or early hours in the morning for two consecutive days; and (2) commencing a driving shift in the mornings, the afternoon or the early hours of the morning after being off-duty for more than 24 h. To meet the challenge of maintaining a nonstop service while simultaneously minimizing the crash risk associated with these risk patterns, a mathematical program was developed, and it was found that rescheduling based on our algorithm could reduce the incidence of crashes by approximately 30 percent. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Case-study approach; Driver scheduling; Intercity bus safety,"Buses; Fleet operations; Risks; Scheduling; Case study approach; Circadian rhythms; Driver fatigue; Driver scheduling; Driving hours; Mathematical program; Non-stop service; Sleep deprivation; Accidents; algorithm; car driving; case control study; complication; fatigue; human; occupational accident; personnel management; prevention and control; risk factor; somnolence; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; traffic accident; workload; Accidents, Occupational; Accidents, Traffic; Algorithms; Automobile Driving; Case-Control Studies; Fatigue; Humans; Linear Models; Personnel Staffing and Scheduling; Risk Factors; Sleepiness; Workload",2-s2.0-85054301238

Gender differences were investigated in college students’ media-related perceived attention problems (PAP) and their attention self-regulatory strategies (SRS). Also examined were the gender moderating effects on the correlations of attention problems and regulatory strategies with six dimensions of social media usage and four cognitive- and adjustment-related criteria: online search strategies, media-multitasking self-efficacy (MMSE), positive/negative self-esteems, and academic achievement. Participants were 771 undergraduate and graduate students from 10 universities in Taiwan. Gender measurement invariance was established in the research instrument. Males exhibited higher PAP than females. Females demonstrated more versatile strategy use to regulate their attention with increased social media use, while males applied more behavioral strategies over social media use as disorientation increased during online searches. Higher MMSE was associated with higher executive and orienting problems for females, and higher alerting problems for males. Higher orienting problems was associated with more negative self-esteem for males. Females with higher PAP reported poorer academic achievement. Implications for practical intervention of PAPs are discussed for each gender group to promote college students’ psychological well-being with regard to social media use and learning performance. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Digital distraction; Gender studies; Media multitasking self-efficacy; Meta-attention; Self-esteem; Social Media,Behavioral research; Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Interactive computer systems; Multitasking; Online searching; Social networking (online); Digital distraction; Gender studies; Meta-attention; Self efficacy; Self esteem; Social media; Students,2-s2.0-85053037420

Methods: Patients on regular follow-up at the Glaucoma Clinic at Hsin-Chu General Hospital were recruited. After detailed ocular examinations, the participants were asked to recall and identify their glaucoma eye drops. The same test was repeated 3 months later. The results of both tests, the learning ability of patients regarding their glaucoma drugs, and the relationship between learning ability and demographic variables were evaluated. Results: Two hundred eighty-seven glaucoma patients participated in this study. Of the study population, 25.8% and 57.1% could recall their topical mediation at the first and second tests, whereas 72.1% and 88.5% could identify their prescribed eye drops at the first and second tests, respectively. Approximately 34% of the participants showed improved knowledge at the repeat test, whereas 40% of the participants showed no improvement. Participants with a better learning ability were more likely to be younger, with a higher level of education, and with less visual field impairment. Conclusion: The knowledge of glaucoma patients regarding their prescribed medication was deficient in Taiwan. Physician effort could improve knowledge on the prescribed drugs.

The dynamic changes in serial sMICA levels and their association with HCC in the post-curative status are elusive. Methods: Single nucleotide polymorphism rs2596542 of MICA and serial sMICA levels were analyzed in chronic hepatitis C patients with a sustained virologic response after antivirals. Forty-two patients who developed HCC and 84 age-matched, gender-matched, and cirrhosis propensity score-matched non-HCC controls were compared. Serial sMICA levels were measured within 6?months before treatment initiation (pre-sMICA), 6?months after the end of treatment (post-sMICA), and on the last visit before the development (or not) of HCC (last-sMICA). Results: Cox regression analysis revealed that last-sMICA was the only predictive factor of HCC development (hazard ratio/95% confidence interval: 2.27 (per 1 log pg/mL increase)/1.672–3.082, P?<?0.001). Patients without HCC development showed a significantly reduced trend of sMICA levels during follow-up (trend P?=?0.001), which was observed only in GG genotype (trend P?<?0.001) but not A allele carriers (P?=?0.88). In contrast, patients with HCC showed an increased trend of sMICA levels (trend P?=?0.024). However, only the GG genotype “high expressors” (trend P?=?0.06) but not A allele carriers (P?=?0.18) showed a correlation of substantially increased trend of sMICA levels and HCC development.

Although the major dominant microbiota within individuals have been reported, the change of gut microbiome caused by external factors, such as antibiotic use and bowel cleansing, remains unclear. We conducted this study to investigate the change of gut microbiome in overweight male adults after bowel preparation, where none of the participants had been diagnosed with any systemic diseases. Methods: A total of 20 overweight, male Taiwanese adults were recruited, and all participants were omnivorous. The participants provided fecal samples and blood samples at three time points: prior to bowel preparation, 7 days after colonoscopy, and 28 days after colonoscopy. The microbiota composition in fecal samples was analyzed using 16S ribosome RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Results: Our results demonstrated that the relative abundance of the most dominant bacteria hardly changed from prior to bowel preparation to 28 days after colonoscopy. Using the ratio of Prevotella to the sum of Prevotella and Bacteroides in the fecal samples at baseline, the participants were separated into two groups. The fecal samples of the Type 1 group was Bacteroides-dominant, and that of the Type 2 group was Prevotella-dominant with a noticeable presence Bacteroides. Bulleidia appears more in the Type 1 fecal samples, while Akkermensia appears more in the Type 2 fecal samples. Of each type, the gut microbial diversity differed slightly among the three collection times. Additionally, the Type 2 fecal microbiota was temporarily susceptible to bowel cleansing. Predictive functional analysis of microbial community reveals that their activities for the mineral absorption metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism differed significantly between the two types. Depending on their fecal type, the variance of triglycerides and C-reactive protein also differed between the two types of participants. Conclusions: Depending upon the fecal type, the microbial diversity and the predictive functional modules of microbial community differed significantly after bowel preparation. In addition, blood biochemical markers presented somewhat associated with fecal type. Therefore, our results might provide some insights as to how knowledge of the microbial community could be used to promote health through personalized clinical treatment. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Bacteroides; Bowel preparation; Gut microbiome; High-throughput sequencing; Overweight; Preovotella,arachidonic acid; C reactive protein; RNA 16S; sodium dihydrogen phosphate; triacylglycerol; 16S rRNA gene; adult; Article; Bacteroides; body mass; colonoscopy; controlled study; fatty acid metabolism; feces analysis; gene sequence; human; intestine flora; intestine preparation; male; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; obesity; population research; Prevotella; Taiwanese; biodiversity; feces; microbiology; middle aged; obesity; young adult; Adult; Biodiversity; Feces; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Overweight; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85059278365

The diagnosis is based on changes to the ""normal"" vaginal microbiome; however, the normal microbiome appears to differ according to reproductive status and ethnicity, and even among individuals within these groups. The Amsel criteria and Nugent score test are widely used for diagnosing BV; however, these tests are based on different criteria, and so may indicate distinct changes in the vaginal microbial community. Nevertheless, few studies have compared the results of these test against metagenomics analysis. Methods: Vaginal flora samples from 77 participants were classified according to the Amsel criteria and Nugent score test. The microbiota composition was analyzed using 16S ribosome RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Bioinformatics analysis and multivariate statistical analysis were used to evaluate the microbial diversity and function. Results: Only 3 % of the participants diagnosed BV negative using the Amsel criteria (A-) were BV-positive according to the Nugent score test (N+), while over half of the BV-positive patients using the Amsel criteria (A+) were BV-negative according to the Nugent score test (N-). Thirteen genera showed significant differences in distribution among BV status defined by BV tests (e.g., A - N-, A + N- and A + N+). Variations in the four most abundant taxa, Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, Prevotella, and Escherichia, were responsible for most of this dissimilarity. Furthermore, vaginal microbial diversity differed significantly among the three groups classified by the Nugent score test (N-, N+, and intermediate flora), but not between the Amsel criteria groups. Numerous predictive microbial functions, such as bacterial chemotaxis and bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, differed significantly among multiple BV test, but not between the A- and A+ groups. Conclusions: Metagenomics analysis can greatly expand our current understanding of vaginal microbial diversity in health and disease. Metagenomics profiling may also provide more reliable diagnostic criteria for BV testing. ? 2018 The Author(s).",,"RNA; RNA 16S; bacterial DNA; adult; amplicon; Article; bacterial transmission; bioinformatics; epithelium cell; Escherichia; female; Gardnerella; human; Lactobacillus; microbial diversity; microflora; nonhuman; Prevotella; RNA sequence; species invasion; vagina flora; vaginitis; genetic variation; genetics; microbiology; vagina; vaginitis; Adult; DNA, Bacterial; Female; Genetic Variation; Humans; Microbiota; Vagina; Vaginosis, Bacterial",2-s2.0-85059255589

In recent years, solution processing combined with direct-patterning techniques such as micro-/nanomolding, inkjet printing, e-jet printing, e-beam writing, and photopatterning has drawn much attention because of the inexpensive and simple fabrication process that avoids using capital-intensive vacuum deposition systems and chemical etching. Furthermore, practical applications of solution direct-patterning techniques with metal oxide structures are demonstrated in thin-film transistors and biochemical sensors on a wide range of substrates. Since direct-patterning techniques enable low-cost fabrication of nanoscale metal oxide structures, these methods are expected to accelerate the development of nanoscale devices and systems based on metal oxide components in important application fields such as flexible electronics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and human health monitoring. Here, a review of the fabrication procedures, advantages, limitations, and applications of the main direct-patterning methods for making metal oxide structures is presented.

Recently, evolutionary conservation has been indicated containing understandable signatures for functional significance in cancers. However, the importance of evolutionary conservation in distinguishing cancer subtypes remains unclear. Here, we identified the evolutionarily conserved genes (i.e., core gene) and observed that they are mainly involved in the pathways relevant to cell growth and metabolisms. By using these core genes, we integrated their evolutionary and genomic profiles with deep learning to develop a feature-based strategy (FES) and an image-based strategy (IMS). In comparison with FES using the random set and the strategy using the PAM50 classifier, core gene set-based FES has higher accuracy for identifying breast cancer subtypes. Moreover, the IMS with data augmentation yields better performance than the other strategies. Comprehensive analysis of eight TCGA cancer data demonstrates that our evolutionary conservation-based models provide a valid and helpful approach to identify cancer subtypes and the core gene set offers distinguishable clues of cancer subtypes. ? 2018 IEEE.",Cancer genomics; Cancer subtype; Convolutaional neural network; Copy number alteration; Deep learning; Evolutionary conservation; Gene expression,Bioinformatics; Diseases; Gene expression; Breast Cancer; Cancer genomics; Cancer subtypes; Comprehensive analysis; Copy-number alterations; Data augmentation; Evolutionary conservations; Genomic profiles; Deep learning,2-s2.0-85060375487

Most PCa is slowly growing and usually early symptomless. About 70% of PCa patients were diagnosed at later stage and metastasis has been observed. Additionally, the cure rate of PCa closely relies on the early diagnosis with biomarkers. Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) is currently the only clinical biomarker for PCa diagnosis. However, the PSA test has inherent limitations and has about 75% of false-positive results. The identification of a set of genes (as biomarkers) for diagnosis and prognosis is an urgent clinical issue for PCa. Here, we integrated genome-wide analysis and protein-protein interaction network to identify potential genes for early diagnostic biomarkers of PCa. First, we collected gene expression datasets of 145 PCa samples, consisting of both tumor and corresponding normal tissues, from two different sources in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We found 158 and 268 significantly highly and lowly expressed genes, respectively, in tumor samples. Moreover, we proposed cluster score (CS) and predicting score (PS) to select 28 prostate cancer-related genes (called PCa28). The results indicate that PCa28 can discriminate between the normal/tumor tissues and are specific for prostate cancer. Finally, we examined 8 genes in PCa28 on four PCa cell lines by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Experimental results show that up-regulated genes have higher expression level in tumor cells in comparison to normal cells, and down-regulated genes have lower expression level in tumor cells. We believe that our method is useful and PCa28 are potential biomarkers that provide the clues to develop targeting therapy for PCa. ? 2018 IEEE.",Diagnosis; Gene expression profiling; Prostate cancer; Protein-protein interaction network,Bioinformatics; Biomarkers; Cell culture; Diagnosis; Diseases; Gene expression; Histology; Polymerase chain reaction; Proteins; Tumors; Urology; Diagnosis and prognosis; Diagnostic biomarkers; Gene expression datasets; Gene expression profiling; Inherent limitations; Prostate cancers; Protein-protein interaction networks; Quantitative polymerase chain reaction; Calcium compounds,2-s2.0-85060368468

The compound n-Butylidenephthalide (BP) is isolated from Angelica sinensis, which is used to treat anemia and gynecological dysfunction in traditional Chinese medicine. Studies have indicated that BP can inhibit cancers, including brain, lung, prostate, liver, and colon cancers. However, because BP is a natural hydrophobic compound, it is quickly metabolized by the liver within 24 h, and thus has limited potential for development in cancer therapy. This study investigated the anticancer mechanisms of BP through encapsulation with a novel polycationic liposome containing polyethylenimine (PEI) and polyethylene glycol complex (LPPC) in melanoma cells. The results demonstrated that BP/LPPC had higher cytotoxicity than BP alone and induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in B16/F10 melanoma cells. The BP/LPPC-treated cell indicated an increase in subG1 percentage and TUNEL positive apoptotic morphology through induction of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. The combination of BP and LPPC and clinical drug 5-Fluorouracil had a greater synergistic inhibition effect than did a single drug. Moreover, LPPC encapsulation improved the uptake of BP values through enhancement of cell endocytosis and maintained BP cytotoxicity activity within 24 h. In conclusion, BP/LPPC can inhibit growth of melanoma cells and induce cell arrest and apoptosis, indicating that BP/LPPC has great potential for development of melanoma therapy agents. ? 2018 by the authors.",Melanoma; N-Butylidenephthalide; Polycationic liposome containing PEI and polyethylene glycol complex (LPPC),"antineoplastic agent; butylidenephthalide; drug carrier; liposome; macrogol; phthalic anhydride; polyamine; polycations; polyethyleneimine; Angelica sinensis; animal; cell proliferation; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; human; isolation and purification; melanoma; metabolism; mouse; tumor cell line; Angelica sinensis; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Drug Carriers; Humans; Liposomes; Melanoma; Mice; Phthalic Anhydrides; Polyamines; Polyethylene Glycols; Polyethyleneimine",2-s2.0-85057753754

Previously, DMC significantly inhibited on-target cisplatin resistance protein, ERCC1, via PI3K-Akt-snail pathways in NSCLC. However, low water solubility and bioavailability of DMC causes systemic elimination and prevents its clinical application. To increase its bioavailability and targeting capacity toward cancer cells, a DMC-polyvinylpyrrolidone core phase was prepared, followed by encapsulating in a CHC shell to form a DMC-loaded core-shell hydrogel nanoparticles (DMC-CHC NPs). We aimed to understand whether DMC-CHC NPs efficiently potentiate cisplatin-induced apoptosis through downregulation of ERCC1 in NSCLC. DMC-CHC NPs displayed good cellular uptake efficiency. Dissolved in water, DMC-CHC NPs showed comparable cytotoxic potency with free DMC (dissolved in DMSO). A sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay indicated that DMC-CHC NPs significantly increased cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity by highly efficient intracellular delivery of the encapsulated DMC. A combination of DMC-CHC NPs and cisplatin significantly inhibited on-target cisplatin resistance protein, ERCC1, via the PI3K-Akt pathway. Also, this combination treatment markedly increased the post-target cisplatin resistance pathway including bax, and cytochrome c expressions. Thymidine phosphorylase (TP), a main role of the pyrimidine salvage pathway, was also highly inhibited by the combination treatment. The results suggested that enhancement of the cytotoxicity to cisplatin via administration of DMC-CHC NPs was mediated by down-regulation of the expression of TP, and ERCC1, regulated via the PI3K-Akt pathway. ? 2018 by the authors.

Also, considerable attention has been devoted to raising awareness of the often-untenable assumption of homogeneous error variance among treatment groups. Although the procedures for detecting interactions between treatment and predictor variables are well documented in the literature, the corresponding problem of power and sample size calculations has received relatively little attention. In order to facilitate interaction design planning, this article describes power and sample size procedures for the extended Welch test of difference between two regression slopes under heterogeneity of variance. Two different formulations are presented to explicate the implications of appropriate reliance on the predictor variables. The simplified method only utilizes the partial information of predictor variances and has the advantages of statistical and computational simplifications. However, extensive numerical investigations showed that it is relatively less accurate than the more profound procedure that accommodates the full distributional features of the predictors. According to the analytic justification and empirical performance, the proposed approach gives reliable solutions to power assessment and sample size determination in the detection of interaction effects. A numerical example involving kidney weigh and body weigh of crossbred diabetic and normal mice is used to illustrate the suggested procedures with flexible allocation schemes. Moreover, the organ and body weights data is incorporated in the accompany SAS and R software programs to illustrate the ease and convenience of the proposed techniques for design planning in interactive research. ? 2018 Gwowen Shieh.

Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been used as biomarkers due to their effective role in cancer diagnosis. This study proposes a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier SVM-BRC to categorize patients with breast cancer into early and advanced stages. SVM-BRC uses an optimal feature selection method, inheritable bi-objective combinatorial genetic algorithm, to identify a miRNA signature which is a small set of informative miRNAs while maximizing prediction accuracy. MiRNA expression profiles of a 386-patient cohort of breast cancer were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas. SVM-BRC identified 34 of 503 miRNAs as a signature and achieved a 10-fold cross-validation mean accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews correlation coefficient of 80.38%, 0.79, 0.81, and 0.60, respectively.

Patients and Methods: Data from the National Health Insurance Research Database from January 1, 1999, to July 31, 2011, were analyzed, and patients with diabetes weaning from dialysis-requiring AKI were identified. Cox proportional hazards models and inverse-weighted estimates of the probability of treatment were used to adjust for treatment selection bias. The outcomes were incident end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, and hospitalized heart failure. Results: Of a total of 6165 patients with diabetes weaning from dialysis-requiring AKI identified, 5635 (91.4%) patients were DPP4i nonusers and 530 (8.6%) patients were DPP4i users. Compared with DPP4i nonusers, DPP4i users had a lower risk of ESRD (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-0.94; P=.04) and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.23-0.34; P<.001) after adjustments for CKD, advanced CKD, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker use. In contrast, the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and hospitalized heart failure did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusion: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor users had a lower risk of ESRD and mortality than did nonusers among patients with diabetes after weaning from dialysis-requiring AKI. Therefore, a prospective study of AKI to CKD transitions after episodes of AKI is needed to optimally target DPP4i interventions. ? 2018 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research",,"alpha glucosidase inhibitor; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antidiabetic agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; glitazone derivative; insulin; meglitinide; metformin; sulfonylurea; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; acute kidney failure; adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; cardiovascular risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; dialysis; drug effect; drug potentiation; end stage renal disease; female; heart failure; human; major adverse cardiac event; major clinical study; male; mortality; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; outcome assessment; acute kidney failure; case control study; chronic kidney failure; complication; diabetic nephropathy; disease exacerbation; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; proportional hazards model; prospective study; Acute Kidney Injury; Adult; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Nephropathies; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies",2-s2.0-85055027596

The APPJ was characterized by optical emission spectroscopy. We induced Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in rats with different amounts of STZ combined with normal and high-fat diets, respectively. The wound area ratio of all the plasma-treated normal and diabetic groups was greatly reduced (up to 30%) compared with that of the untreated groups during healing. Histological analysis revealed faster re-epithelialization, collagen deposition, less inflammation, and a complete skin structure in the plasma-treated groups was found as compared with the untreated control groups. In addition, the new blood vessels of plasma-treated tissues decreased more than untreated tissues in the middle (Day 14) and late (Day 21) stages of wound healing. The plasma-treated wounds demonstrated more transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) expression in the early stage (Day 7), whereas they decreased in the middle and late stages of wound healing. The levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT) increased after plasma treatment. In addition, plasma-treated water had a higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide, nitrite and nitrate when the plasma treatment time was longer. In summary, the proposed argon APPJ based on the current study could be a potential tool for treating diabetic wounds. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,"argon; catalase; glutathione peroxidase; streptozocin; superoxide dismutase; transforming growth factor beta; animal; atmospheric pressure; disease model; drug effect; experimental diabetes mellitus; male; metabolism; pharmacology; physiology; plasma gas; rat; skin; Sprague Dawley rat; wound healing; Animals; Argon; Atmospheric Pressure; Catalase; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Disease Models, Animal; Glutathione Peroxidase; Male; Plasma Gases; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Skin; Streptozocin; Superoxide Dismutase; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Wound Healing",2-s2.0-85051624524

In this work, the flexible localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) bio-sensors were demonstrated by integrating the metal–insulator–metal (MIM) nanodisks with bio-compatible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. The different geometries of MIM nanodisk sensors were investigated and optimized to enhance the spatial overlap of the LSPR waves with the environment, which lead to a high sensitivity of 1500 nm/RIU. The omni-directional characteristics of LSPR resonances were beneficial for maintaining the device sensitivity stable under various bending curvatures. Furthermore, the flexible MIM nanodisk LSPR sensor was applied to detect A549 cancer cells in PBS+ solution. The absorption peak of the MIM-disk LSPR sensor obviously redshift to easily distinguish between the phosphate buffered saline (PBS+) solution with A549 cancer cells and without cells. Therefore, the flexible MIM nanodisk LSPR sensor is suitable to develop on-chip microfluidic biosensors for detection of cancer cells on nonplanar surfaces. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85051177384

We recently reported general loss of brain complexity, as measured by multiscale sample entropy (MSE), at pain-related regions in females with primary dysmenorrhea (PDM). However, it is unclear whether this loss of brain complexity is associated with inter-subject genetic variations. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a widely expressed neurotrophin in the brain and is crucial to neural plasticity. The BDNF Val66Met single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with mood, stress, and pain conditions. Therefore, we aimed to examine the interactions of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and long-term menstrual pain experience on brain complexity. We genotyped BDNF Val66Met SNP in 80 PDM females (20 Val/Val, 31 Val/Met, 29 Met/Met) and 76 healthy female controls (25 Val/Val, 36 Val/Met, 15 Met/Met). MSE analysis was applied to neural source activity estimated from resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals during pain-free state. We found that brain complexity alterations were associated with the interactions of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and menstrual pain experience. In healthy female controls, Met carriers (Val/Met and Met/Met) demonstrated lower brain complexity than Val/Val homozygotes in extensive brain regions, suggesting a possible protective role of Val/Val homozygosity in brain complexity. However, after experiencing long-term menstrual pain, the complexity differences between different genotypes in healthy controls were greatly diminished in PDM females, especially in the limbic system, including the hippocampus and amygdala. Our results suggest that pain experience preponderantly affects the effect of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on brain complexity. The results of the present study also highlight the potential utilization of resting-state brain complexity for the development of new therapeutic strategies in patients with chronic pain.

Pred-Meta utilizes three feature types, including texture, morphology, and grayscale, and an optimal feature selection method cooperated with SVM. The data set consists of 75 samples from 70 patients in head and neck cancer provided by Taipei Veterans General Hospital of Taiwan with a record of lymphatic metastasis. Pred-Meta using leave-one-out cross-validation achieved 100% in predicting metastasis. The merit of the Pred-Meta method is its non-invasiveness and low cost. Auxiliary physicians screen out patients with high risk of diversion in the early stages to help plan treatment guidelines. The limitation of Pred-Meta suffers from the small number of training samples. It is expected that Pred-Meta would perform better in testing independent cohort when the number of training samples significantly increases. ? 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Head; Machine learning; Metastasis; Neck cancer; Support vector machine,Artificial intelligence; Body fluids; Diseases; Forecasting; Learning systems; Pathology; Patient treatment; Robotics; Sampling; Support vector machines; Textures; Tumors; Computed tomography images; Head; Leave-one-out cross validations; Lymphatic metastasis; Metastasis; Neck cancer; Optimal feature selections; Pathological section; Computerized tomography,2-s2.0-85061555845

In 2015, a color-dust explosion disaster occurred in the Formosa Fun Coast of Taiwan and injured 499 people, who were transferred via a nationwide emergency delivery system. Some recommendations are currently available regarding vitamin and mineral support for wound healing and recovery in severe burns, but there is a lack of evidence to confirm the benefits. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate the effects of additional vitamin and mineral support for patients with severe burn injuries. Sixty-one hospitalized individuals with major burns (full thickness and ?20% TBSA) were classified into the supplement (n = 30) and control (n = 31) groups, according to whether they received supplementation with additional vitamins, calcium, and magnesium. There were significant differences between the supplement and control groups in the incidence of wound infection (30.0% vs. 77.4%, p < 0.001), sepsis (13.3% vs. 41.9%, p = 0.021), and hospitalization days (51.80 vs. 76.81, p = 0.025). After adjustment, logistic regression analysis revealed that, compared to those in the control group, patients in the supplement group had a lower risk for wound infection (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.03–0.43; p = 0.002) and sepsis (OR 0.09; 95% CI 0.01–0.61; p = 0.014). Supplementation of multiple vitamins, calcium, and magnesium reduced the risk of wound infection and sepsis, shortened the time of hospitalization, and can be considered for use in major burns. ? 2018 by the authors.

Here, we showed that the concomitant activation of small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) current (IKAS) and inhibition of sodium current by cyclohexyl-[2-(3,5-dimethyl-pyrazol-1-yl)-6-methyl-pyrimidin-4-yl]-amine (CyPPA) recapitulate the phenotypes of JWS in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. CyPPA induced significant J wave elevation and frequent spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (SVF), as well as sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and intraventricular conduction delay. IKAS activation by CyPPA resulted in heterogeneous shortening of action potential (AP) duration (APD) and repolarization alternans. CyPPA inhibited cardiac sodium current (INa) and decelerated AP upstroke and intracellular calcium transient. SVFs were typically triggered by short-coupled premature ventricular contractions, initiated with phase 2 reentry and originated more frequently from the right than the left ventricles. Subsequent IKAS blockade by apamin reduced J wave elevation and eliminated SVF. β-Adrenergic stimulation was antiarrhythmic in CyPPA-induced electrical storm. Like CyPPA, hypothermia (32.0°C) also induced J wave elevation and SVF. It facilitated negative calcium-voltage coupling and phase 2 repolarization alternans with spatial and electromechanical discordance, which were ameliorated by apamin. These findings suggest that IKAS activation contributes to the development of JWS in rabbit ventricles.",Arrhythmias; Cardiology; Cardiovascular disease; Ion channels,,2-s2.0-85059100850

Herein, we introduce the V2O5 nanosheets (NS) as a novel nanozyme to biomimic the oxidase activity toward the rapid detection of glutathione. The 5–6 layered V2O5 NS with 300–600 nm in size is successfully fabricated by ultra-sonication assisted exfoliation of bulk V2O5 using N, N-dimethyl formamide as the intercalation reagent. The sensing mechanism involves the oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by V2O5 NS with the concomitant increase in absorption intensity. Upon introduction of glutathione, the oxidized TMB is converted back to its original form and results in the simultaneous decrease in peak intensity at 650 nm. The sensor exhibits a good linear response to glutathione in the range of 10–500 nM with a limit of detection of 2.4 nM. Moreover, the V2O5-TMB sensor exhibits a good selectivity and high speci?city, which makes the detection of glutathione applicable in diluted human serum samples. Since no functionalization of the V2O5 NS is required, this sensing system can open a new avenue to serve as an efficiently biomimic oxidase for glutathione detection in biological fluid samples. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB); Biomimic oxidase activity; Glutathione; Nanozyme; V2O5 nanosheets","Amides; Body fluids; Nanosheets; Vanadium pentoxide; Absorption intensity; Glutathiones; N ,N-Dimethylformamide; Nanomolar detection; Nanozyme; Oxidase activity; Sensitive measurement; Tetramethylbenzidine; Peptides",2-s2.0-85049758137

Nowadays, in hospital, AVF are assessed by ultrasound Doppler machines, which are bulky, expensive, complicated-to-operate, and time-consuming. In this study, new PPG sensors were proposed and developed successfully to provide portable and inexpensive solutions for AVF assessments. To develop the sensor, at first, by combining the dimensionless number analysis and the optical Beer Lambert’s law, five input features were derived for the SVM classifier. In the next step, to increase the signal-noise ratio (SNR) of PPG signals, the front-end readout circuitries were designed to fully use the dynamic range of analog-digital converter (ADC) by controlling the circuitries gain and the light intensity of light emitted diode (LED). Digital signal processing algorithms were proposed next to check and fix signal anomalies. Finally, the class-weighted SVM classifiers employed five different kernel functions to assess AVF quality. The assessment results were provided to doctors for diagonosis and detemining ensuing proper treatments. The experimental results showed that the proposed PPG sensors successfully achieved an accuracy of 89.11% in assessing health of AVF and with a type II error of only 9.59%. ? 2018 by the authors.

In addition, to confirm its applicability in long chained complex DNA system, the sensor was also applied to the clinically isolated DENV DNA and showed satisfactory performances for serotype identification as well as quantification. We hope this simple and reliable method can pave an avenue for the development of sensitive and robust sensing probes in biomedical applications. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"DNA; Gold nanoparticles; Medical applications; Nucleic acids; Probes; Semiconductor quantum dots; Viruses; Biomedical applications; Concentration ranges; Detection methods; Differential pulse; DNA quantification; Fluorescence technique; Real-time application; Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; Polymerase chain reaction; nanocomposite; virus DNA; chemistry; Dengue virus; DNA probe; electrochemical analysis; genetic procedures; genetics; human; particle size; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; serotype; surface property; Biosensing Techniques; Dengue Virus; DNA Probes; DNA, Viral; Electrochemical Techniques; Humans; Nanocomposites; Particle Size; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Serogroup; Surface Properties",2-s2.0-85054969424

Our laboratory recently developed a new method for non-invasive recording of the skin sympathetic nerve activity (SKNA) using conventional electrocardiography (ECG) patch electrodes. Recent studies showed that SKNA can adequately estimate sympathetic tone in humans. In order to improve the analysis of SKNA, we developed automatic standard assessment system based on the concept of microneurography and applied to non-invasive SKNA recording via 4 steps of signal processing. Every parameters in procedures can be manually selected by users in order to meet requirements. After using these signal processing, the results obtained by this system show improved nerve burst morphology and trend. Intuitive nerve discharge pattern and occurrence frequency can be automatically generated. Verification of the method with the cold water pressor test data further established the reliability and usefulness of the system. This new method offered a convenient tool to evaluate SKNA for comprehensive and detailed application in neurocardiology. The analysis system may facilitate the study between SKNA and cardiac arrhythmia, thus advance the field of neurocardiology research. ? 2018 IEEE.",Cold water pressor test; Microneurography; Nerve assessment system; Skin Sympathetic Nerve Activity,Diseases; Electrocardiography; Assessment system; Automatically generated; Cold waters; Detection and quantifications; Microneurography; Non-invasive recording; Occurrence frequencies; Sympathetic nerve activity; Biomedical signal processing,2-s2.0-85057629553

The early assessment of disease risk is an emerging topic in medical informatics. If diseases are detected at an early stage, prognosis can be improved and medical resources can be used more efficiently. For example, if rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is detected at an early stage, appropriate medications can be used to prevent bone deterioration. In early disease risk assessment, finding important risk factors from large-scale medical databases and performing individual disease risk assessment have been challenging tasks. A number of recent studies have considered risk factor analysis approaches, such as association rule mining, sequential rule mining, regression, and expert advice. In this study, to improve disease risk assessment, machine learning and matrix factorization techniques were integrated to discover important and implicit risk factors. A novel framework is proposed that can effectively assess early disease risks, and RA is used as a case study. This framework comprises three main stages: data preprocessing, risk factor optimization, and early disease risk assessment. This is the first study integrating matrix factorization and machine learning for disease risk assessment that is applied to a nation-wide and longitudinal medical diagnostic database. In the experimental evaluations, a cohort established from a large-scale medical database was used that included 1007 RA-diagnosed patients and 921,192 control patients examined over a nine-year follow-up period (2000–2008). The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is more efficient and stable for disease risk assessment than state-of-the-art methods. ? 2018 Chin et al.

We aimed to determine whether post-treatment fibrotic modification overwhelmed pretreatment fibrotic status in terms of long-term HCC prediction. Methods: 265 SVR patients with paired biopsies before and after antiviral therapy were enrolled for analysis of the association of fibrotic changes with HCC. Results: Eighteen (6.8%) of the 265 patients developed HCC over 1931 person-years. Cox regression analysis without post-treatment fibrosis as a covariant revealed that factors predicted HCC included age (hazard ratio [HR]/confidence intervals [CI] 1.07/1.01–1.13, p = 0.01), male gender (HR/CI 4.57/1.45–14.36, p = 0.009), diabetes (HR/CI 3.60/1.32–9.85, p = 0.01) and pretreatment advanced fibrosis (HR/CI 2.73/1.05–7.07, p = 0.039). Advanced fibrosis in post-treatment status replaced pretreatment fibrosis as the most critical determinant of HCC when it was included for analysis (HR/CI 3.53/1.34–9.30, p = 0.01). The incidences of HCC among patients with fibrotic modification from F0–2 to F0–2, F34 to F0–2, F0–2 to F34 and F34 to F34 were 0.41%, 0.84%, 1.68%, and 3.05%, respectively (p = 0.004). Compared to patients whose fibrotic stage remained at F0–2 before and after treatment, the HCC risk decreased and did not differ among those whose fibrotic stage improved from F34 to F0–2. However, HCC risk increased significantly and gradually in patients whose fibrotic stages changed from F0–2 to F34 (HR/CI 4.13/1.11–15.36, p = 0.035) and whose fibrotic stages remained at F34 before and after treatment (HR/CI 7.47/2.37–23.55, p = 0.001) (trend p = 0.003).

The association between chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and uric acid levels has rarely been investigated. We aimed to evaluate the levels of serum uric acid in CHC patients. Methods Three hundred and seventy-three histologically confirmed CHC patients who were scheduled to receive antiviral therapy were consecutively enrolled, and 746 age- and sex-matched uninfected controls were included for comparison. Hyperuricemia was defined as a uric acid level > 7 mg/dL in men and > 6.0 mg/dL in women. Results Hyperuricemia was identified in 15.8% of the CHC patients. The uric acid levels did not differ between the CHC patients and the controls (5.54 ± 1.20 mg/dL vs. 5.45 ± 1.45 mg/dL, P = 0.3). Among the 373 CHC patients, the factors associated with hyperuricemia included body mass index (BMI) (OR/CI: 1.13/1.04–1.21, P = 0.003) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (OR/CI: 0.98/0.97–1.00, P = 0.02). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the factors associated with hyperuricemia in male patients included BMI (OR/CI: 1.12/1.05–1.30, P = 0.006) and advanced fibrosis (F3-4) (OR/CI: 0.27/0.09–0.83, P = 0.02), whereas the factors associated with hyperuricemia in female patients included eGFR (OR/CI: 0.97/0.95–0.99, P = 0.02) and diabetes (OR/CI: 3.03/1.11–8.25, P = 0.03). There was a significant decreasing trend of serum uric acid levels with the progression of fibrotic stages among male patients (6.21 ± 1.03 mg/dL 5.82 ± 1.16 mg/dL and 5.44 ± 1.28 mg/dL in stages F0-2, F3, and F4, respectively, trend P = 0.01).

Typically, DNA methylation is thought to repress the expression of nearby genes. However, the cases in which DNA methylation promotes gene expression have been reported. In addition, globally, to what extent DNA methylation affects gene expression and how it contributes to the pathogenesis of KD are not yet well understood. METHODS: To address these important biological questions, we enrolled subjects, collected DNA and RNA samples from the subjects' total white blood cells, and performed DNA methylation (M450K) and gene expression (HTA 2.0) microarray assays. RESULTS: By analyzing the variation ratios of CpG beta values (methylation percentage) and gene expression intensities, we first concluded that the CpG markers close (-?1500?bp to +?500?bp) to the transcription start sites had higher variation ratios, reflecting significant regulation capacities. Next, we observed that, globally speaking, gene expression was modestly negatively correlated (correlation rho???-?0.2) with the DNA methylation status of both upstream and downstream CpG markers in the promoter region. Third, we found that specific CpG markers were hypo-methylated in disease samples compared with healthy samples and hyper-methylated in convalescent samples compared with disease samples, promoting and repressing S100A genes' expressions, respectively. Finally, using an in vitro cell model, we demonstrated that S100A family proteins enhanced leukocyte transendothelial migration in KD. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to integrate genome-wide DNA methylation with gene expression assays in KD and showed that the S100A family plays important roles in the pathogenesis of KD.",Correlation; CpG marker; DNA methylation; Gene expression; Kawasaki disease; Leukocyte transendothelial migration; S100A gene family,"protein S 100; cell line; CpG island; DNA methylation; DNA sequence; epigenetics; female; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetic epigenesis; genetics; genome-wide association study; human; mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; procedures; promoter region; transendothelial and transepithelial migration; Cell Line; CpG Islands; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Epigenomics; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome; Promoter Regions, Genetic; S100 Proteins; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Transendothelial and Transepithelial Migration",2-s2.0-85055849236

This study investigates the risk of active TB among persons with T2DM who were treated with various ADT and insulin therapies. Methods: We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study using the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database, including 49 028 T2DM patients who were metformin users (n = 44 002) or non-users (n = 5026). A total of 5026 propensity score-matched pairs of metformin users and non-users with T2DM were evaluated from 1998 to 2010. The data were analysed using Cox proportional hazard models. Results: Patients with T2DM had a significantly higher rate of incident TB than did the control subjects (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.01; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.80–2.25). After adjusting for comorbidities, diabetes complications, ADT type and statin use, metformin use was an independent factor for predicting a reduced risk of active TB (adjusted relative risk (aRR): 0.24; 95% CI: 0.18–0.32). The association between metformin use and active TB risk was also consistent in most subgroup analyses, except for patients with metabolic disorders (aRR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.11–1.87). This protective effect of metformin was dose-dependent but diminished gradually in the elderly population. Conclusion: Among all types of ADT and insulin therapies, metformin is the only agent with a decreased risk of active TB in the T2DM population. However, this effect was diminished in the elderly population and was not observed in patients with metabolic disorders. ? 2018 Asian Pacific Society of Respirology",anti-diabetic therapy; diabetes mellitus; latent tuberculosis; metformin; tuberculosis,"hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; insulin; metformin; antidiabetic agent; metformin; protective agent; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; diabetic complication; disease association; disease severity; drug effect; drug use; female; glycemic control; human; infection risk; insulin treatment; major clinical study; male; metabolic disorder; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; population risk; priority journal; risk assessment; risk reduction; social status; tuberculosis; very elderly; incidence; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; proportional hazards model; risk factor; Taiwan; tuberculosis; Aged; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incidence; Male; Metformin; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Protective Agents; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Tuberculosis",2-s2.0-85054635551

Since bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates are epigenetically toxic, the purpose of this study was to examine whether BPA and phthalate metabolites, including monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MIBP), mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP), and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), have an epigenetic impact on ADAM33 and the incidence of breast cancer. CpG Islands of breast cancer microarray datasets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were used to assess the ADAM33 methylation profile. We designed a case-control study including 44 cases and 22 age-matched controls to detect the methylation status of intron 1 in ADAM33 from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in blood, using BSP, nested PCR, and bisulfite sequencing, and measured the in vivo gene expression of ADAM33 and the urinary concentrations of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), using real-time PCR, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Only one dataset, GSE32393, reached significance (P=0.016). ADAM33 expression and methylation frequencies at CpG site 3 in intron 1 were higher in the control group. We found a positive association between intron 1 methylation level and ADAM33 expression as well as urinary concentrations of MEHHP, MECPP, MEOHP and S 4 MEHP (the sum of MEHP, MECPP, MEHHP, and MEOHP) in the cases. This study suggests that metabolites of phthalate such as MEHHP, MECPP, MEOHP and S 4 MEHP may increase the intron 1 methylation level to elevate ADAM33 gene expression and have a protective effect on reducing the risk of breast cancer. ? 2018 Oncology Reports.

In the proposed SoC, a 16-channel neural-signal acquisition unit (NSAU), a biosignal processor (BSP), a 16-channel high-voltage-tolerant stimulator (HVTS), and wireless power and bidirectional data telemetry are designed. In the NSAU, the input protection circuit is used to prevent MOSFET from overstressing by the high-voltage stimulations. Hence, NSAUs can share electrodes with stimulators. The auto-reset chopper-stabilized capacitive-coupled instrumentation amplifiers (AR-CSCCIAs) are designed with the chopper-stabilized technique with a new offset reduction loop. The measured input-referred noise is 2.09 μ Vrms and the noise-efficiency factor (NEF) is 3.78. The entropy-and-spectrum seizure detection algorithm is implemented in the BSP with 0.76-s seizure detection latency and 97.8% detection accuracy. When the seizure onset is detected by the BSP, the HVTS with adaptive supply control delivers 0.5-3-mA biphasic current stimulation to suppress the seizure onset. The proposed SoC is powered wirelessly, and the bidirectional data telemetry is realized through the same pair of coils in 13.56 MHz. The downlink data rate is 211 Kb/s with the binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation and a new BPSK demodulator. The uplink data rate is 106 Kb/s with the load-shift keying (LSK) modulation.

Foodborne illness outbreaks caused by E. coli O157:H7 have become a global issue. Since SLTs are quite toxic, effective medicines that can reduce the damage caused by SLTs should be explored. SLTs consist of a single A and five B subunits, which can inhibit ribosome activity for protein synthesis and bind with the cell membrane of host cells, respectively. Pigeon ovalbumin (POA), i.e. a glycoprotein, is abundant in pigeon egg white (PEW) proteins. The structure of POA contains Gal-α(1→4)-Gal-β(1→4)-GlcNAc ligands, which have binding affinity toward the B subunit in SLT type-1 (SLT-1B). POA immobilized gold nanoparticles (POA-Au NPs) can be generated by reacting PEW proteins with aqueous tetrachloroauric acid in one-pot. The generated POA-Au NPs have been demonstrated to have selective trapping-capacity toward SLT-1B previously. Herein, we explore that POA-Au NPs can be used as protective agents to neutralize the toxicity of SLT-1 in SLT-1-infected model cells. The results show that the cells can be completely rescued when a sufficient amount of POA-Au NPs is used to treat the SLT-1-infected cells within 1 h. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",artificial cells; Escherichia coli O157:H7; gold nanoparticles; microcapsules; pigeon egg whites; pigeon ovalbumin; Shiga like toxin-1; targeted delivery,Binding energy; Biosynthesis; Cells; Cytology; Diseases; Escherichia coli; Fiber optic sensors; Metal nanoparticles; Proteins; Toxic materials; Artificial cell; Egg white; Escherichia coli O157:H7; Microcapsules; Ovalbumins; Shiga-like toxins; Targeted delivery; Gold nanoparticles; gold nanoparticle; verotoxin 1; gold; metal nanoparticle; ovalbumin; verotoxin 1; absorption spectroscopy; Article; biocompatibility; cell growth; cell lysate; cell viability; controlled study; fluorescence microscopy; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; lethality; mass spectrometry; microscopy; MTT assay; NCTC clone 929 cell line; particle size; protein immobilization; transmission electron microscopy; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; chemistry; drug effect; Escherichia coli O157; materials testing; physiology; Animals; Escherichia coli O157; Gold; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Materials Testing; Metal Nanoparticles; Ovalbumin; Shiga Toxin 1,2-s2.0-85042075972

To increase the survival rate of the patient, early diagnosis is necessary. To achieve this, bronchoscopists usually use endobronchial ultrasound for navigating surgery in endobronchoscopy. However, because the bronchoscopist has to continuously re-navigate/re-target the bronchoscope to collect specimens from the same tumor, the whole navigating/targeting process has to be repeated many times in one surgery. Due to this, navigating/targeting the bronchoscope to correct/same tumor is still a time-consuming process. Therefore, a more accurately tumor-targeting approach is needed to significantly save time in navigating surgery. To address this issue, recently researchers combined electromagnetic (magnetic-sensor-based) targeting technology with conventional endobronchial ultrasound as a hybrid targeting approach to achieve a more accurate realtime tumor-targeting in endobronchoscopy [1]. However, when comparing conventional bronchoscopes, the bronchoscope with magnetic sensor is more expensive and less compatible. Thus, a cheaper and compatible electromagnetic targeting technology is required. Recently, some researchers demonstrated electromagnetic-induction/magnetic-interaction approaches to target distal screw-hole in intramedullary interlocking-nail surgery [2]-[5]. We think that these targeting approaches can be modified to develop as a new, cheaper, and compatible electromagnetic targeting technology for general endobronchoscopy. Hence, in this paper, we demonstrate the electromagnetic targeting system for endobronchoscopy. ? 2018 IEEE.",,Diagnosis; Diseases; Electromagnetic induction; Magnetic sensors; Surgery; Tumors; Ultrasonics; Bronchoscopist; Early diagnosis; Interlocking nails; Lung Cancer; Screw hole; Survival rate; Targeting Systems; Tumor targeting; Air navigation,2-s2.0-85066785340

In this work, nanocomposites of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and Fe3O4 with conjugation of lectin protein, concanavalin A, to form GQD-ConA@Fe3O4 nanocomposites are developed for both detection of cancer cell and release of drugs to HeLa cells. The GQD-ConA@Fe3O4 nanocomposites deposited on Pt electrode can detect cancerous HeLa cells over normal endothelial cells with a dynamic linear range of 5 × 102 to 1 × 105 cells mL?1 with a detection limit of 273 cell mL?1. The GQD-ConA@Fe3O4 also can serve as nanocarriers for loading and delivering doxorubicin (Dox). The in vitro cell images show that the Dox concentration in HeLa cells is enhanced more than double in the presence of external magnetic field due to the incorporation of Fe3O4 in the nanocarrier. The cytotoxicity assay indicates that the susceptibility of cancerous HeLa cells to Dox is 13% higher than that of normal cells, confirming the selective role of ConA in nanocarriers. Results clearly indicate the GQD-ConA@Fe3O4 nanocomposites as a promising material for cancer cell detection and targeted Dox release toward HeLa cells which can serve as the multifunctional platform for novel cancer cell diagnostic and therapeutic applications. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Biosensing; Cancerous cells; Doxorubicin; Electrochemical detection; Multifunctional nanocomposites,Chemical detection; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; Endothelial cells; Image enhancement; Iron oxides; Lanthanum compounds; Magnetite; Nanocomposites; Proteins; Semiconductor quantum dots; Biosensing; Cancerous cells; Doxorubicin; ELectrochemical detection; Multifunctional nanocomposites; Targeted drug delivery; concanavalin A; doxorubicin; graphene; graphene quantum dot concanavalin A iron oxide nanocomposite; iron oxide; lectin; nanocarrier; nanocomposite; quantum dot; unclassified drug; concanavalin A; doxorubicin; graphite; magnetite; nanocomposite; platinum; quantum dot; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer cell; cancer diagnosis; concentration (parameters); conjugation; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug release; drug targeting; drug uptake; endothelium cell; HeLa cell line; in vitro study; limit of detection; magnetic field; priority journal; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; electrode; human; neoplasm; Cell Survival; Concanavalin A; Doxorubicin; Drug Delivery Systems; Electrodes; Endothelial Cells; Ferrosoferric Oxide; Graphite; HeLa Cells; Humans; Limit of Detection; Nanocomposites; Neoplasms; Platinum; Quantum Dots,2-s2.0-85046167997

The recent advance in polymer thin film transistors (TFTs) can realize high sensitivity and low-cost gas sensors. Ammonia gas interacts with charge carrier channels and polymer/dielectrics interface through Coulomb force. This is the first report of high sensitivity and reusable ammonia sensor fabricated from thiophene-isoindigo donor–acceptor conducting polymer. This kind of polymer has advantages of simple synthesis and excellent air stability. The systematic study is carried out to investigate relationship among chemical structure variation and morphology control of polymer to the performance of ammonia sensor. High crystallinity, favored crystal orientation, and direct percolation routes for analytes are found to be essential to increase the susceptibility of polymers to ammonia gas. By strengthening edge-on morphology, the sensitivity can be enhanced fivefold for the same polymer.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of uveitis on the development of various keratopathies via the use of the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan. METHODS. Approximately 1 million patients were randomly sampled from the registry of the NHIRD. Patients diagnosed with uveitis by ophthalmologists were enrolled in the study group after exclusion. Each individual in the study group was age and sex matched to four non-uveitis individuals who serve as the control group. In addition to keratopathy, other possible risk factors and medications were included in the multivariate model, and the effects of different subtypes of uveitis for developing keratopathies were also analyzed. RESULTS. A total of 4773 uveitis patients (2662 male and 2111 female) and 19,092 non-uveitis patients (10,648 male and 8444 female) were enrolled. There were 406 events of keratopathy in the study group, and another 764 events occurred in the control group. A higher incidence rate was found in the study group after adjustment (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.772), with a greater cumulative probability (P < 0.0001). For the subgroup analysis, anterior uveitis (aHR = 1.765) and panuveitis (aHR = 3.386) increased the risk of developing keratopathies. Moreover, male sex was associated with a higher aHR than female sex for developing keratopathies in the study group. CONCLUSIONS. The presence of uveitis significantly elevates the risk for developing keratopathy. ? 2018 The Authors.",Cornea; Keratopathy; Population-based; Uveitis,"azathioprine; betamethasone; corticosteroid; cyclophosphamide; cyclosporine; dexamethasone; leflunomide; methotrexate; methylprednisolone; prednisolone; salazosulfapyridine; tacrolimus; triamcinolone; immunosuppressive agent; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; cornea edema; cornea neovascularization; cornea opacity; cornea ulcer; diabetes mellitus; female; follow up; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; ICD-9; iridocyclitis; keratitis; keratoconjunctivitis; keratopathy; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; polyarteritis nodosa; priority journal; relapsing polychondritis; retrospective study; rheumatoid arthritis; risk factor; Sjoegren syndrome; systemic lupus erythematosus; treatment outcome; uveitis; Wegener granulomatosis; adult; aged; classification; complication; cornea disease; factual database; incidence; middle aged; public health; sex factor; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; uveitis; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Corneal Diseases; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; National Health Programs; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Taiwan; Uveitis",2-s2.0-85055601021

Materials and Methods: A total of 3050 patients from 17 public breast cancer data sets containing IHC marker receptor status (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]) and their molecular classification (basal-like, HER2-enriched, luminal A or B) were analyzed. Diagnostic accuracy and concordance as measured with the κ statistic were calculated between the IHC and molecular classifications. Simulations were performed to assess the relationship between accuracy of imaging-based IHC markers to predict molecular classification. A simulation was performed to examine effects of misclassification of molecular type on patient survival. Results: Accuracies of intrinsic subtypes based on IHC subtype were 71.7% (luminal A), 53.7% (luminal B), 64.8% (HER2-enriched), and 81.7% (basal-like). The κ agreement was fair (κ = 0.36) for luminal A and HER2-enriched subtypes, good (κ = 0.65) for the basal-like subtype, and poor (κ = 0.09) for the luminal B subtypes. Introduction of image misclassification by simulation lowered image-true subtype accuracies and κ values. Simulation analysis showed that misclassification caused survival differences between luminal A and basal-like subtypes to decrease. Conclusion: There is poor concordance between triple-receptor status and intrinsic molecular subtype in breast cancer, arguing against their use in the design of prognostic genomic-based image biomarkers. ?

However, at high volume fractions needed for intravenous injection, safe, highly biocompatible phospholipids cannot form such nanoparticles due to the fluidity of phospholipid shells. Here we overcome this challenge using a nano-surfactant, a sterilized 18-amino-acid biomimetic of the amphipathic helical motif abundant in HDL-apolipoproteins. As it induces a nanoscale phase (glass) transition in the phospholipid monolayer, the peptide stabilizes 5–7 nm phospholipid micelles that do not fuse at high concentrations but aggregate into stable micellesomes exhibiting size-dependent penetration into tumors. In mice bearing human Her-2-positive breast cancer xenografts, high-payload paclitaxel encapsulated in 25 nm (diameter) micellesomes kills more cancer cells than paclitaxel in standard clinical formulation, as evidenced by the enhanced apparent diffusion coefficient of water determined by in vivo MR imaging. Importantly, the bio-inertness of this biomimetic nano-surfactant spares the nanoparticles from being absorbed by liver hepatocytes, making them more generally available for drug delivery. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Amphipathic peptides; Apolipoproteins; Breast cancer; Drug delivery; Fluid-gel transition; Her-2; Lipoproteins; Liposomes; Micelle; Nano medicine; Paclitaxel; Phospholipid; Surfactant,"Biocompatibility; Biomimetics; Controlled drug delivery; Diffusion in liquids; Diseases; Drug delivery; Glass transition; Lipoproteins; Liposomes; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Micelles; Nanoparticles; Peptides; Surface active agents; Surface diffusion; Targeted drug delivery; Tumors; Amphipathic peptides; Apolipoproteins; Breast Cancer; Fluid-gel transitions; Her-2; Paclitaxel; Phospholipids; amino acid; apolipoprotein; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; nanoparticle; paclitaxel; phospholipid; paclitaxel; peptide; phospholipid; surfactant; apparent diffusion coefficient; Article; biocompatibility; biomimetics; breast cancer; cancer cell; controlled study; drug safety; in vitro study; in vivo study; liver cell; membrane fluidity; micelle; nanoanalysis; nanomedicine; priority journal; protein motif; protein stability; reticuloendothelial system; tumor xenograft; animal; biomimetics; breast tumor; chemistry; drug screening; female; human; mouse; procedures; tumor cell line; Animals; Biomimetics; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Female; Humans; Mice; Micelles; Paclitaxel; Peptides; Phospholipids; Surface-Active Agents; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-85051017638

Design: Observational, cross-sectional study. Setting: A university hospital gait laboratory with an 8-camera motion analysis system, 3 forceplates, a pair of instrumented crutches, and a WRE. Participants: Patients (N=12) with paraplegic SCI. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: The inclination angle (IA) of the body's center of mass (COM) relative to the center of pressure (COP), and the rate of change of IA (RCIA) for balance control, and the mechanical energy and forward COM momentum before and after seat-off for energetics during WRE-assisted STS were compared between conditions with 2 initial hip angles (105° and 115°) and 3 initial hip angular velocities (800, 1000, 1200 rpm). Results: No interactions between the main factors (ie, initial hip angle vs angular velocity) were found for any of the calculated variables. Greater initial hip angle helped the patients with SCI move the body forward with increased COM momentum but reduced RCIA (P<.05). With increasing initial angular hip velocity, the IA and RCIA after seat-off (P<.05) increased linearly while total mechanical energy reduced linearly (P<.05). Conclusions: The current results suggest that a greater initial hip angle with smaller initial angular velocity may provide a favorable compromise between momentum transfer and balance of the body for people with SCI during WRE-assisted STS. The current data will be helpful for improving the design and clinical use of the WRE. ? 2018 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine",Exoskeleton device; Postural balance; Rehabilitation; Spinal cord injury,American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale; Article; body equilibrium; clinical article; cross-sectional study; energy; energy transfer; female; fibula head; greater trochanter; ground reaction force; hip; human; joint characteristics and functions; lateral malleolus; male; muscle strength; observational study; paraplegia; sitting; spinal cord injury; standing; adult; body equilibrium; complication; exoskeleton (rehabilitation); movement (physiology); paraplegia; pathophysiology; physiology; sitting; spinal cord injury; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exoskeleton Device; Female; Hip; Humans; Male; Movement; Paraplegia; Postural Balance; Sitting Position; Spinal Cord Injuries; Standing Position,2-s2.0-85048490107

A nationwide, matched cohort, population-based study enrolled a total of 4103 patients with newly diagnosed charcoal-burning suicide attempts, between 2000 and 2010, which were selected from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, along with 12,309 controls matched for sex and age. After adjusting for confounding factors, Fine and Gray's competing risk analysis was used to compare the risk of developing dementia during the 10-year follow-up period. Of the enrolled patients (n=16,412), dementia developed in 303 (1.85%), including 2.56% in the study group (105 in 4103) and 1.61% (198 in 12,309) in the control group. The Fine and Gray's survival analysis revealed that the patients with charcoal-burning suicide attempts were likely to develop dementia, with a crude HR of 5.170 (95% CI 4.022 to 6.644, p<0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, geographic area and urbanization level of residence, and monthly insured premium, the adjusted HR was 4.220 (95% CI 3.188 to 5.586, p<0.001). Suicide attempts were associated with an increased risk of degenerative dementia in this study.

The black dye incorporated as the dopant in the DDLC mixture features a high dichroic ratio and wide visible-light absorption band so that the level of disturbance in DDLC orientation in the presence of biomolecules can be readily observed with the naked eye. Due to the absorption and anisotropic features of DDLC, transmission spectrometry was exploited to establish a quantitative method for DDLC-based biosensing. Our results indicate that the transmittance of DDLC decreased with increasing concentration of bovine serum albumin (BSA), a common protein standard, and the detection sensitivity can be improved by using linearly polarized light during spectral measurement. A linear correlation between the spectral parameters of DDLC and BSA concentration was thus derived to facilitate protein quantitation. As a demonstration of clinical relevance, a label-free DDLC-based immunoassay for the cancer biomarker CA125 was manifested by reacting CA125 with immobilized anti-CA125 antibody. The transmittance of DDLC decreased with increasing concentration of CA125, but when a nonspecific protein such as BSA was reacted with the anti-CA125 antibody, the transmission spectrum was similar to that in the absence of CA125, suggesting that immunodetection via the DDLC-based biosensing platform was specific. It is evident from this study that with its unique dichroic and optical properties, DDLC is a potential biosensing material with capabilities of both qualitative detection as required in rapid screening as well as quantitative bioassay as in cancer screening. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Biosensor; Bovine serum albumin; Cancer antigen 125; Dye-doped liquid crystal; Quantitative detection,Absorption spectroscopy; Antibodies; Antigens; Bioassay; Biosensors; Body fluids; Diseases; Light; Light absorption; Light polarization; Liquid crystals; Mammals; Optical properties; Surface plasmon resonance; Bovine serum albumins; Cancer antigen 125; Detection sensitivity; Dye doped liquid crystal; Linearly polarized light; Quantitative detection; Transmission spectrums; Visible light absorption; Doping (additives); Antibodies; Diseases; Light; Light Absorption; Liquid Crystals,2-s2.0-85046130747

Since air pollution has grave impacts on human health, industry experts are starting to fathom how to integrate particulate matter (PM) sensors into portable devices; however, traditional micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) gas sensors are too large. To overcome this challenge, experts from industry and academia have recently begun to investigate replacing the traditional etching techniques used on MEMS with semiconductor-based manufacturing processes and materials, such as gallium nitride (GaN), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and silicon. However, studies showing how to systematically evaluate and select suitable materials are rare in the literature. Therefore, this study aims to propose an analytic framework based on multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) to evaluate and select the most suitable materials for fabricating PM sensors. An empirical study based on recent research was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of our analytic framework. The results provide an invaluable future reference for research institutes and providers. ? 2018 by the authors.",Micro electro mechanic systems (MEMS); Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM); Particulate matter (PM); PM2.5; Sensors,,2-s2.0-85054087275

As such a chip that is meant to be implanted and used for very long periods, growing retinal cells on it to improve the electrical stimulation efficiency and attraction of neuronal elements remains a challenge. Here, an inkjet printing technology is employed to create graphene oxide (GO) micropatterns onto microelectrodes of a photovoltaic-powered implantable retinal chip. These GO micropatterns allow human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells to specially attach and grow in each microelectrode. In addition, the cell proliferation, viability, and tight junction of RPE cells are improved during culturing. The development of a simple surface-coating technology would pave the way for the development of the first fully integrated and encapsulated retinal prostheses with biocompatible on-chip microelectrodes for long-term implantation, which could be effectively applied in retina tissue engineering and therapy. ? 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We propose PinchMove, a highly accurate navigation mechanic utilizing pinch gestures and manipulation of the viewport for confined environments that prefers accurate movement. We ran a pilot study to first determine the degree of simulator sickness caused by this mechanic, and a comprehensive user study to evaluate its accuracy in a virtual environment. We found that utilizing an 80°tunneling effect at a maximum speed of 15.18°per second was deemed suitable for PinchMove in reducing motion sickness. We also found our system to be at average, more accurate in enclosed virtual environments when compared to conventional methods. This paper makes the following three contributions: 1) We propose a navigation solution in near-field virtual environments for accurate movement, 2)we determined the appropriate tunneling effect for our method to minimize motion sickness, and 3) We validated our proposed solution by comparing it with conventional navigation solutions in terms of accuracy of movement. We also propose several use- case scenarios where accuracy in movement is desirable and further discuss the effectiveness of PinchMove. ? 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",,Diseases; Mechanics; Navigation; Virtual reality; Confined environment; Conventional methods; Motion sickness; Navigation in virtual en-vironments; Navigation solution; Simulator sickness; Tunneling effects; Use case scenario; Human computer interaction,2-s2.0-85056644700

Methods In total, 535 consecutive HCC patients undergoing resection were included and their clinicopathological data and overall survival were recorded. Both the tumor and adjacent non-tumor (ANT) tissues were subjected to immunohistochemistry analysis for the expression of autophagy-related markers. Results Death was observed for 219 patients, and the cumulative overall survival rates at 1, 3, 5 and 7 years were 91.0%, 72.3%, 58.8%, and 27.7%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, mortality was significantly associated with the following: diminished LC3 expression in both the tumor and ANT tissues, in the HCC tissues alone and in the ANT tissues alone (hazard ratio/95% confidence interval: 6.74/2.052–22.19, 6.70/1.321–33.98 and 2.58/1.499–4.915, respectively); recurrent HCC (5.11/3.136–8.342); HBV infection (2.75/1.574–4.784); cirrhosis (1.78/1.059–2.974); and antiviral therapy (0.42/0.250–0.697). The 5-year overall survival rates were 70.2%, 57.3%, 49.6% and 10.7% for patients with positive LC3 expression in both tissue types, in the HCC tissues alone, in the ANT tissues alone, and in neither tissue type, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rates were 56.7%, 47.3%, 51.2% and 38.7% for patients with HBV-related HCC, cirrhosis, no antiviral therapy, and recurrent HCC, respectively, and these rates were significantly lower than those in their counterparts. Conclusions Patients with recurrent HCC, HBV-related HCC, cirrhosis, and the absence of antiviral therapy showed significantly lower overall survival rates.

Both z scores for height and weight were negatively correlated with age (r = –.693 and ?0.718, respectively; p <.01). The most prevalent clinical manifestations were speech delay (100%) and intellectual disability (100%), followed by hirsutism (93%), hyperactivity (79%), coarse facial features (68%), sleep disorders (61%), and hepatosplenomegaly (61%). Ten patients (36%) had epilepsy, and the median age at the first seizure was 11 years. Thirteen patients (46%) experienced at least one surgical procedure. At the time of the present study, 7 of the 28 patients had passed away at the median age of 13.0 years. Molecular studies showed an allelic heterogeneity without clear genotype and phenotype correlations. MPS IIIB is the most frequent subtype among MPS III in the Taiwanese population.

Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted using data collected from the LHID for the period from 2009 to 2013. This study enrolled patients who received a diagnosis of blepharitis according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, diagnostic code. The exclusion criteria were legal blindness, eyeball removal, ocular tumours prior to the diagnosis of blepharitis, and patients diagnosed with blepharitis and initiated antibiotic treatment concurrently. An age-matched, gender-matched and disease-matched population without blepharitis served as the control group. Multivariate analysis with a multiple Cox regression model was applied to analyse the data. Results In this study, a total of 10 093 patients with blepharitis were included in the study group, and another 40 372 participants without blepharitis were included in the control group. Conditional logistic regression revealed a higher cumulative probability of hyperlipidaemia and coronary arterial disease. After adjustment, patients with blepharitis had a higher probability of developing new MetS than controls. According to subgroup analysis, hyperlipidaemia and coronary artery diseases were significantly correlated with the prior development of blepharitis. However, hypertension and diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance showed no correlation with blepharitis. Conclusion Blepharitis is significantly related to MetS and can serve as an early sign of MetS. Additional studies should examine the relationship between blepharitis and MetS in terms of severity. ?

The clinical relevance of TSP-2 has been explored in many different cancers. TSP-2 expression levels vary between different cancer types, and their role in tumor progression remains controversial. Although previous studies have reported higher serum TSP-2 levels in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the role of TSP-2 in lung cancer progression remains to be addressed. A total of 585 lung adenocarcinoma datasets, including mRNA sequencing and clinical data, were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Forty paired adjacent normal tissues and lung tumor tissue datasets were used to examine TSP-2 expression levels. Tumor microarray were performed with immunohistochemical staining to examine TSP-2 expression in lung cancer patients. Transwell migration assay, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot were used to investigate molecular mechanism of TSP-2 in lung cancer cell. TSP-2 promotes matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) expression, cell migration, and cell invasion by mediating integrin αvβ3/FAK/Akt/NF-κB signal transduction. Using TSP-2 knockdown stable cell lines, we found that TSP-2 knockdown reduces MMP-13 expression and cell mobility. When we manipulated the tumor tissue microarray and TCGA datasets to investigate the clinical relevance of TSP-2, we found high TSP-2 expression levels in lung cancer specimens. The present study demonstrates that TSP-2 regulates cell mobility through MMP-13 expression in lung cancer cells. In addition, TSP-2 expression was associated with MMP-13 expression and poor prognosis in lung cancer. TSP-2 may therefore be a promising novel target for lung cancer treatment. ? 2018",Lung cancer; Migration; MMP-13; TSP-2,"collagenase 3; focal adhesion kinase; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; protein kinase B; thrombospondin 2; vitronectin receptor; collagenase 3; MMP13 protein, human; thrombospondin; thrombospondin 2; Article; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; carcinogenesis; cell invasion; cell migration; cell motility; controlled study; gene knockdown; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; lung adenocarcinoma; lung cancer cell line; metastasis; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; tissue microarray; Western blotting; A-549 cell line; biosynthesis; cell motion; chemically induced; drug effect; enzyme induction; enzymology; lung tumor; pathology; physiology; tumor invasion; A549 Cells; Cell Movement; Enzyme Induction; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Matrix Metalloproteinase 13; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Thrombospondins",2-s2.0-85051675715

However, its effect on glucose and lipid metabolism in early life remains unknown. Objective: We evaluated the associations between early-life arsenic exposure and profiles of glucose and lipids in a 15-year birth cohort in central Taiwan. Methods: We studied 237 adolescents through 5 waves of follow-up interviews and examinations at ages of approximately 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 y. We obtained at least one follow-up urine measurement for arsenic species and blood sample collection up to 14 y of age and identified group-based trajectories of serial iAs by semiparametric mixture modeling. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were performed to assess the effect of the arsenic exposure trajectory on serum fasting glucose, total cholesterol (TCHO), triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). Results: Three trajectories of postnatal arsenic exposure were identified, namely stable-low (31.4%), stable-high (48.2%), and rising-high (20.4%) groups. Compared with the stable-low trajectory group, the percent changes in TCHO and LDL was 14% (95% confidence interval 4–24%) and 23% (9–38%) for the group with “rising-high” trajectory and was 8% (?1–16%) and 16% (4–29%) for the group with “stable-high” trajectory. The rising-high group was also associated with an increase in the TCHO/HDL ratio by 14% (95% CI 3%–25%). The adjusted odds ratios of high developmental trajectories of TCHO, TG, LDL, and non-HDL levels were 4.0 (95% CI 1.2–13.7), 12.2 (2.2–67), 7.3 (1.8–30), and 3.6 (0.9–14.6), respectively, in the rising-high group (reference: stable-low group). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that conversion to an atherogenic lipid profile in adolescents may be associated with early-life exposure to environmental arsenic, particularly during the pre-adolescent period. An environmental modification approach for preventing As-related cardiovascular disease is recommended to begin early in life. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Arsenic; Birth cohort; Glucose metabolism; Insulin resistance; Lipid profile; Trajectory,"Arsenic; Body fluids; Cardiology; Cholesterol; Diseases; Glucose; Lipoproteins; Metabolism; Physiology; Birth cohort; Cardio-vascular disease; Glucose metabolism; High-density lipoprotein cholesterols; Insulin resistance; Lipid profile; Logistic regressions; Low density lipoproteins; Trajectories; arsenic; cholesterol; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; arsenic; lipid; arsenic; cardiovascular disease; cohort analysis; diabetes; health impact; lipid; metabolism; pollution exposure; young population; adolescence; adolescent; Article; atherogenesis; blood sampling; child; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; early life exposure; environmental exposure; environmental stress; exposure; female; follow up; glucose blood level; human; human tissue; interview; lipid metabolism; major clinical study; male; pilot study; priority journal; Taiwan; urinalysis; atherosclerosis; blood; environmental exposure; lipid metabolism; preschool child; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; Adolescent; Arsenic; Atherosclerosis; Child; Child, Preschool; Environmental Exposure; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85047751861

METHODS The study cohort included newly diagnosed nonalcoholic LC patients age ? 40 years old without a diagnosis of CAD from 2006 until 2011 from a longitudinal health insurance database. The mean follow-up period for the study cohort was 1152 ± 633 d. The control cohort was matched by sex, age, residence, and index date. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using the Cox proportional hazard model and the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS After exclusion, a total of 3409 newly diagnosed nonalcoholic cirrhotic patients were identified from one million samples from the health insurance database. We found that CAD (5.1% vs 17.4%) and hyperlipidemia (20.6% vs 24.1%) were less prevalent in nonalcoholic LC patients than in normal subjects (all P < 0.001), whereas other comorbidities exhibited an increased prevalence. Among the comorbidities, chronic kidney disease exhibited the highest risk for mortality (adjusted HR (AHR) = 1.76; 95%CI: 1.55-2.00, P < 0.001). Ascites or peritonitis exhibited the highest risk of mortality among nonalcoholic cirrhotic patients (AHR = 2.34; 95%CI: 2.06-2.65, P < 0.001). Finally, a total of 170 patients developed CAD after a diagnosis of nonalcoholic LC. The AHR of CAD in nonalcoholic LC patients was 0.56 (95%CI: 0.43-0.74, P < 0.001). The six-year survival rates for nonalcoholic LC patients with and without CAD were 52% and 50%, respectively (P = 0.012). CONCLUSION We conclude that CAD was less prevalent and associated with a reduced risk of mortality in nonalcoholic cirrhotic patients. ?

AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) and ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) are crucial in endothelial homeostasis. The mechanism by which AMPK regulates ACE2 in the pulmonary endothelium and its protective role in PH remain elusive. Objectives: We investigated the role of AMPK phosphorylation of ACE2 Ser680 in ACE2 stability and deciphered the functional consequences of this post-translational modification of ACE2 in endothelial homeostasis and PH. Methods: Bioinformatics prediction, kinase assay, and antibody against phospho-ACE2 Ser680 (p-ACE2 S680) were used to investigate AMPK phosphorylation of ACE2 Ser680 in endothelial cells. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genomic editing, we created gain-offunction ACE2 S680D knock-in and loss-of-function ACE2 knockout (ACE22/2) mouse lines to address the involvement of p-ACE2 S680 and ACE2 in PH. The AMPK-p-ACE2 S680 axis was also validated in lung tissue from humans with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Measurements and Main Results: Phosphorylation of ACE2 by AMPK enhanced the stability of ACE2, which increased Ang (angiotensin) 1-7 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase-derived NO bioavailability. ACE2 S680D knock-in mice were resistant to PH as comparedwithwild-type littermates. Incontrast,ACE2-knockoutmice exacerbated PH, a similar phenotype found in mice with endothelial cell-specific deletion of AMPKa2. Consistently, the concentrations of phosphorylated AMPK, p-ACE2 S680, and ACE2 were decreased in human lungs with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Conclusions: Impaired phosphorylation of ACE2 Ser680 by AMPK in pulmonary endothelium leads to a labile ACE2 and hence is associated with the pathogenesis of PH. Thus, AMPK regulation of the vasoprotective ACE2 is a potential target for PH treatment. ? 2018 by the American Thoracic Society.",AMP-activated protein kinase; Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; Pulmonary hypertension; Vascular endothelium,"angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin[1-7]; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; controlled study; CRISPR-CAS9 system; endothelium cell; enzyme phosphorylation; enzyme stability; gene deletion; homeostasis; human; human tissue; loss of function mutation; lung endothelium; lung parenchyma; male; mouse; nonhuman; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein processing; pulmonary hypertension; rat; animal; disease model; enzymology; knockout mouse; lung; metabolism; pathophysiology; pulmonary hypertension; Sprague Dawley rat; vascular endothelium; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Endothelium, Vascular; Humans; Hypertension, Pulmonary; Lung; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",2-s2.0-85051456746

The aim of this study was to develop chimeric antigen receptor-modified (CAR) NK-92MI cells targeting carcinoembryonic antigen-expressing (CEA) tumours and increase killing efficacy by pharmacologically modifying CEA-expression. Result: We generated anti-CEA-CAR NK-92MI cells by retroviral vector transduction. This genetically-modified cell line recognised and lysed high CEA-expressing tumour cell lines (LS174T) at 47.54 ± 12.60% and moderate CEA-expressing tumour cell lines (WiDr) at 31.14 ± 16.92% at a 5:1 effector: target (E/T) ratio. The cell line did not lyse low CEA-expressing tumour cells (HCT116) as they did their parental cells (NK-92MI cells). The histone deacetylase-inhibitor (HDAC) sodium butyrate (NaB) and the methylation-inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-AZA), as epigenetic modifiers, induced CEA-expression in HCT116 and WiDr cells. Although the IC 50 of 5 fluorouracil (5-FU) increased, both cell lines showed collateral sensitivity to anti-CEA-CAR NK-92MI cells. The cytolytic function of anti-CEA-CAR NK-92MI cells was increased from 22.99 ± 2.04% of lysis background to 69.20 ± 11.92% after NaB treatment, and 69.70 ± 9.93% after 5-AZA treatment, at a 10:1 E/T ratio in HCT116 cells. The WiDr cells showed similar trend, from 22.99 ± 4.01% of lysis background to 70.69 ± 10.19% after NaB treatment, and 59.44 ± 10.92% after 5-AZA treatment, at a 10:1 E/T ratio.

Therefore, there is a need to identify types of motorcycle crashes that constitute the greatest safety risk to riders - most frequent and most severe crashes. This pilot study seeks exhibit the efficacy of a new approach for prioritizing PTW crash causation sequences as they relate to injury severity to better inform the application of mitigating countermeasures. To accomplish this, the present study constructed a crash sequence-based risk matrix to identify most frequent and most severe motorcycle crashes in an attempt to better connect causes and countermeasures of PTW crashes. Although the frequency of each crash sequence can be computed from crash data, a crash severity model is needed to compare the levels of crash severity among different crash sequences, while controlling for other factors that also have effects on crash severity such drivers’ age, use of helmet, etc. The construction of risk matrix based on crash sequences involve two tasks: formulation of crash sequence and the estimation of a mixed-effects (ME) model to adjust the levels of severities for each crash sequence to account for other crash contributing factors that would have an effect on the maximum level of crash severity in a crash. Three data elements from the National Automotive Sampling System - General Estimating System (NASS-GES) data were utilized to form a crash sequence: critical event, crash types, and sequence of events. A mixed-effects model was constructed to model the severity levels for each crash sequence while accounting for the effects of those crash contributing factors on crash severity. A total of 8039 crashes involving 8208 motorcycles occurred during 2011 and 2013 were included in this study, weighted to represent 338,655 motorcyclists involved in traffic crashes in three years (2011–2013)(NHTSA, 2013). The top five most frequent and severe types of crash sequences were identified, accounting for 23 percent of all the motorcycle crashes included in the study, and they are (1) run-off-road crashes on the right, and hitting roadside objects, (2) cross-median crashes, and rollover, (3) left-turn oncoming crashes, and head-on, (4) crossing over (passing through) or turning into opposite direction at intersections, and (5) side-impacted. In addition to crash sequences, several other factors were also identified to have effects on crash severity: use of helmet, presence of horizontal curves, alcohol consumption, road surface condition, roadway functional class, and nighttime condition. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Motorcycle crashes; Risk matrix; Sequence of events; Traffic safety,"Frequency estimation; Highway accidents; Intersections; Matrix algebra; Risk perception; Traffic control; Contributing factor; Crash severity models; Mixed effects models; Motorcycle crashes; Risk matrix; Road surface condition; Sequence of events; Traffic safety; Motorcycles; classification; drinking behavior; environment; helmet; human; injury; injury scale; motorcycle; pilot study; risk; traffic accident; utilization; Accidents, Traffic; Alcohol Drinking; Environment; Head Protective Devices; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Motorcycles; Pilot Projects; Risk; Wounds and Injuries",2-s2.0-85053904714

The ensuing problem of containing future cascading failures by placement of protection or monitoring nodes in the network is complicated by the uncertainty of the failure source and the missing observation of how the cascading might unravel, be it the past cascading failures or the future ones. This paper examines the problem of minimizing the outage when a cascading failure from a single source occurs. A stochastic optimization problem is formulated where a limited number of protection nodes, when placed strategically in the network to mitigate systemic risk, can minimize the expected spread of cascading failure. We propose the vaccine centrality, which is a network centrality based on the partially ordered sets (poset) characteristics of the stochastic program and distributed message-passing, to design efficient approximation algorithms with provable approximation ratio guarantees. In particular, we illustrate how the vaccine centrality and the poset-constrained graph algorithms can be designed to tradeoff between complexity and optimality, as illustrated through a series of numerical experiments. This paper points toward a general framework of network centrality as statistical inference to design rigorous graph analytics for statistical problems in networks. ? 2007-2012 IEEE.",approximation algorithm; Cascading failure; graph theory and algorithms; large-scale stochastic optimization; message-passing algorithms; network centrality; viral spreading,Economic and social effects; Electric fault currents; Graph theory; Message passing; Optimization; Set theory; Stochastic systems; Vaccines; Cascading failures; Message passing algorithm; Network centralities; Stochastic optimizations; viral spreading; Approximation algorithms,2-s2.0-85048160951

This study aimed to evaluate the real-world cost-effectiveness of IFN-based therapy according to the current strategies with PegIFN/RBV for “easy-to-treat” to provide a reference for application of future DAA development for IFN-eligible, treatment na?ve HCV patients. Methods: A total of 1032 chronic hepatitis C treatment-na?ve patients who corresponded to response-guided therapy (RGT) guidelines of PegIFN/RBV regimens were linked to the entire population of expenditures and order in the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. The average total cost per SVR achieved was calculated as the summation of the total cost for all treated patients/number of SVR cases. Results: Current RGT suggested 24 weeks of PegIFN/RBV for G1 na?ve patients with baseline LVL and RVR at treatment week 4 achieved an average treatment cost per SVR of $5090 ± 2400. This was of superior cost-effectiveness compared with those other subgroups of G1 patients. In terms of G2 patients, according to current RGT of 16 weeks of treatment duration, PegIFN/RBV treatment with RVR achieved was of a very competitive cost per SVR ($3237 ± 488). Conclusion: For a na?ve patient in the new DAA era, the PegIFN/RBV treatment might be conserved for those with all favorable risk parameters, considering the treatment duration and cost per SVR, in the resource-constrained countries. ? 2018",Chronic hepatitis C; Cost-effectiveness analysis; Na?ve; Pegylated interferon; Response-guided therapy,"interferon; peginterferon; ribavirin; virus RNA; alpha interferon; antivirus agent; IL28B protein, human; interferon; interleukin derivative; macrogol; peginterferon alpha2b; recombinant protein; adult; antiviral therapy; Article; chronic hepatitis C; cost effectiveness analysis; drug cost; female; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus genotype 1; human; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; sustained virologic response; treatment duration; treatment response; virus load; aged; chronic hepatitis C; cost benefit analysis; genetics; health care cost; single nucleotide polymorphism; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antiviral Agents; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Health Care Costs; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Interferon alpha-2; Interferon-alpha; Interferons; Interleukins; Male; Middle Aged; Polyethylene Glycols; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Recombinant Proteins",2-s2.0-85047740709

However, the therapeutic response is limited to certain patient populations, and immunotoxicity as well as autoimmunity have compromised the therapeutic benefits. Here, we report on an inherently therapeutic fucoidan–dextran-based magnetic nanomedicine (IO@FuDex3) conjugated with a checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1) and T-cell activators (anti-CD3 and anti-CD28). IO@FuDex3 can repair the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment by reinvigorating tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, while targeting the nanomedicine via magnetic navigation to the tumour to minimize off-target effects. Treatment that combines IO@FuDex3 and magnetic navigation reduces the occurrence of adverse events and extends the median survival from 32 to 63 days with less than 1 per cent dose compared with soluble anti-PD-L1. Thus, we demonstrate the potential of integrating anti-PD-L1 and T-cell activators as a form of inherently therapeutic nanomedicine to augment the therapeutic index of combination checkpoint immunotherapy. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,"Drug products; Medical nanotechnology; Nanoparticles; T-cells; Tumors; Immunomodulators; Magnetic nano-particles; Magnetic navigation; Median survival; Microenvironments; Patient population; Therapeutic benefits; Therapeutic index; Nanomagnetics; antineoplastic agent; CD28 antigen; CD3 antibody; fucoidan dextran superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle; immunological antineoplastic agent; magnetic nanoparticle; programmed death 1 ligand 1 inhibitor; unclassified drug; fucoidin; immunologic factor; magnetite nanoparticle; polysaccharide; 4T1 cell line; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; breast cancer; cancer immunotherapy; CD8+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; drug conjugation; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug safety; drug selectivity; drug synthesis; drug targeting; female; human; immunomodulation; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nanomedicine; nonhuman; priority journal; survival time; T lymphocyte activation; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor microenvironment; animal; drug delivery system; drug effect; immunology; immunotherapy; neoplasm; pathology; procedures; tumor cell line; ultrastructure; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Drug Delivery Systems; Humans; Immunologic Factors; Immunotherapy; Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating; Magnetite Nanoparticles; Mice; Nanomedicine; Neoplasms; Polysaccharides; Tumor Microenvironment",2-s2.0-85046887475

Understanding the current trends in AOI-related morbidity/mortality is essential in improving patient care and optimizing current public health strategies to further reduce AOIs in Taiwan in the era of contemporary highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Methods: Eligible patients were evaluated at two referral centers between 2010 and 2015. The patients were stratified by date of diagnosis into three periods: 2010-2011, 2012-2013, and 2014-2015. The demographics, HIV stage at presentation according to the United States CDC 2014 case definition, laboratory variables, and the occurrence of AOIs and associated outcomes were compared among the patients. Logistic regression and Cox regression were respectively used to identify variables associated with the occurrence of AOIs within 90 days of HIV enrollment and all-cause mortality. Results: Over a mean observation period of 469 days, 1264 patients with newly diagnosed HIV with a mean age of 29 years and mean CD4 count of 275 cells/μL experienced 394 AOI episodes in 290 events. At presentation, 37.7% of the patients had AIDS; the frequency did not significantly differ across groups. The overall proportion of AOIs within the study period was 21.0%, and no decline across groups was observed. The majority of AOIs (91.7%) developed within 90 days of enrollment. All-cause and AOI-related mortality did not significantly differ across groups. Throughout the three study periods, AOIs remained the main cause of death (47/56, 83.9%), especially within 180 days of enrollment (40/42, 95.2%). A CD4 cell count of < 200 cells/μL at presentation was associated with increased adjusted odds of an AOI within 90 days [adjusted odds ratio, 40.84; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 12.59-132.49] and an elevated adjusted hazard of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 11.03; 95% CI, 1.51-80.64). Conclusions: Despite efforts toward HIV prevention and management, early HIV care in Taiwan continues to be critically affected by AOI-related morbidity and mortality in the era of contemporary HAART.

This study was designed to compare the performance of the Adult Treatment Panel III/American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (ATP III/AHA/NHLBI) and International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria for the risks of atherosclerosis and diabetes. Methods: We sifted subjects from a self-paid Health examination program from 1999 to 2015 in this cross-sectional population-based study. On the basis of the ATP III/AHA/NHLBI and IDF criteria, the MetS diagnosis and scores were concluded. A brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) more than or equal to 1400 cm/s indicated more severe arterial stiffness, and a high fasting glucose level more than or equal to 6.99 mmol/L or postprandial glucose level more than or equal to 11.10 mmol/L indicated diabetic-level hyperglycemia. Comparisons of the areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC-ROC) for both MetS scores to correlate with a higher baPWV and diabetic-level hyperglycemia were evaluated. Results: In the 26,735 enrolled subjects with an average age of 55 (± 12) years, 6633 and 7388 (24.8% vs. 27.6%, p < 0.001) were classified as having MetS on the basis of the ATP III/AHA/NHLBI and IDF criteria, respectively. The AUC-ROC for the ATP III/AHA/NHLBI-MetS score were higher than those for the IDF-MetS score (0.685 vs. 0.595 to correlate with a higher baPWV, p < 0.001; 0.791 vs. 0.665 to correlate with diabetic-level hyperglycemia, p < 0.001). Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that through a holistic approach, the performance of the ATP III/AHA/NHLBI-MetS score for the risks of atherosclerosis and diabetes was superior to the IDF-MetS score for Asians. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Arterial stiffness; Atherosclerosis; Cardiovascular disease; Diabetes; Metabolic syndrome,glucose; adult; aged; arterial stiffness; Article; atherosclerosis; cardiovascular disease; clinical evaluation; comparative study; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; female; glucose blood level; holistic care; human; hyperglycemia; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; postprandial state; priority journal; pulse wave; receiver operating characteristic; risk factor; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity,2-s2.0-85050144896

The cross-talk between metastatic cancer cells and bone is critical to the development and progression of bone metastases. In our previous data, we have described how the involvement of the Wnt-induced secreted protein-1/vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (WISP-1/VCAM-1) system in this tumor–bone interaction contributes to human PCa cell motility. In this study, we found that WISP-1 regulates bone mineralization by inducing bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2), BMP4 and osteopontin (OPN) expression in osteoblasts. We also found that WISP-1 inhibited RANKL-dependent osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, osteoblast-derived WISP-1 enhanced VCAM-1 expression in PCa cells and subsequently promoted the adherence of cancer cells to osteoblasts. Furthermore, endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression in PCa cells was regulated by osteoblast-derived WISP-1, which promoted integrin α4β1 expression in osteoblasts via the MAPK pathway. Pretreatment of PCa cells with VCAM-1 antibody or osteoblasts with integrin α4β1 antibody attenuated the adherence of PCa cells to osteoblasts, suggesting that integrin α4β1 serves as a ligand that captures VCAM-1+ metastatic tumor cells adhering to osteoblasts. Our findings reveal that osteoblast-derived WISP-1 plays a key role in regulating the adhesion of PCa cells to osteoblasts via the VCAM-1/integrin α4β1 system. Osteoblast-derived WISP-1 is a promising target for the prevention and inhibition of PCa-bone interaction. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",ET-1; Integrin α4β1; Prostate cancer; VCAM-1; WISP-1,"bone morphogenetic protein 2; endothelin 1; osteoclast differentiation factor; osteopontin; unclassified drug; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; very late activation antigen 4; Wnt induced secreted protein 1; Wnt protein; CCN protein; endothelin 1; oncoprotein; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; very late activation antigen 4; WISP1 protein, human; animal cell; Article; bone mineralization; cell adhesion; controlled study; enzyme inhibition; enzyme regulation; human; human cell; mouse; nonhuman; osteoblast; osteoclastogenesis; priority journal; prostate cancer; protein expression; protein function; protein protein interaction; protein secretion; protein targeting; 3T3 cell line; animal; bone development; bone tumor; cancer transplantation; cell motion; chemistry; coculture; conditioned medium; cytology; gene expression regulation; male; metabolism; osteoblast; prostate tumor; RAW 264.7 cell line; secondary; signal transduction; tumor cell line; 3T3 Cells; Animals; Bone Neoplasms; CCN Intercellular Signaling Proteins; Cell Adhesion; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Coculture Techniques; Culture Media, Conditioned; Endothelin-1; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Integrin alpha4beta1; Male; Mice; Neoplasm Transplantation; Osteoblasts; Osteogenesis; Prostatic Neoplasms; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; RAW 264.7 Cells; Signal Transduction; Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1",2-s2.0-85045446945

Accordingly, the challenging issue of how to effectively retrieve meaningful data from large-scale medical databases for disease assessment has risen. Furthermore, the manner in which early disease risk assessment models can detect disease symptoms is an issue of concern because early detection leads to early treatment. In this paper, with the aim of detecting diseases sooner and more effectively, a novel early disease risk assessment method is proposed, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is used as a case study. The proposed method is to improve the quality and meaning of diagnostic data using novel features and early strategy. To apply EMRs to construct a relationship matrix between patients and diseases, a retrieval method for generalized diagnostic coded information with extracted occurrence numbers was proposed. In order to identify diseases earlier, a disease risk assessment strategy from 7, 60, and 120 days before the onset of T2DM was established. The experimental results showed that the proposed method to improve disease risk assessment achieved high accuracy in terms of AUC-ROC and AUC-PR values.

Not only do women pay great attention to facial care, but in recent years, men's consumption in this area has also grown year by year. In facial care, in addition to sunscreen, skin care, tattoos and other chemical-based skin care products, mechanical skin washing machine has also become one of the most popular beauty appliances in recent years. In order to learn the effectiveness of various face care products and tools, in this paper, we have proposed an intelligent system that integrates face washing, wireless cameras, smart phones, and cloud image analysis functionality to allow users to obtain product recommendations. The proposed system is easy to carry and provides seven analysis functionalities, such as skin color, pigmentation, skin texture, wrinkles, pores, texture analysis, and would produce an in-depth analysis report. The proposed system is not only helpful for personal beauty care, but also beneficial for professional medical clinics and makeup companies. The collected big data will also be utilized as a reference for future cosmetics, and potential medical and biotechnology company product development and marketing. ? 2018 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; Cloud; Image processing; Scalp detection; Skin detection,Artificial intelligence; Chemical analysis; Clouds; Image processing; Intelligent systems; mHealth; Smartphones; Textures; Visual communication; Washing; Analysis system; Biotechnology companies; In-depth analysis; Intelligent skin; Product recommendation; Skin Detection; Texture analysis; Wireless cameras; Skin care products,2-s2.0-85065400293

Therefore, predicting mortality is difficult. An accurate prediction tool may be useful to ensure that end-of-life patients with dementia receive timely palliative care. Purpose This study aims to establish a survival prediction model for elderly patients with dementia in Taiwan. Methods Data from the 2001 to 2010 National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan were used to identify 37,289 patients with dementia aged 65 years for inclusion in this retrospective longitudinal study. Moreover, this study examined the mortality indicators for dementia among demographic characteristics, chronic physical comorbidities, and medical procedures. A Cox proportional hazards model with time-dependent covariates was used to estimate mortality risk, and risk score functions were formulated using a point system to establish a survival prediction model. The prediction model was then tested using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results Thirteen mortality risk factors were identified: age, sex, stroke, chronic renal failure, liver cirrhosis, cancer, pressure injury, and retrospectively retrieved factors occurring in the 6 months before death, including nasogastric tube placement, supplemental oxygen supply, 2 hospitalization, receiving 1 emergency services, 2 occurrences of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and receiving 2 endotracheal intubations. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for this prediction model for mortality at 6 and 12 months were 0.726 and 0.733, respectively. Conclusions The survival prediction model demonstrated moderate accuracy for predicting mortality at 6 and 12 months before death in elderly patients with dementia. This tool may be valuable for helping health care providers and family caregivers to make end-of-life care decisions. ? 2018 Lee et al.

Without doubt, early detection and timely intervention are important to successfully manage osteoporosis and its associated complications. The dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the most popular and standard method to measure BMD. However, limitations including radiation exposure and availability restrict its application for osteoporosis screening among general population. In this study, we developed a simple method to detect human distal radius bone density based on near infrared (NIR) image system. Among 10 volunteers (including 5 young and 5 elderly participants) receiving bone density measurement using our NIR image system at the ultradistal part of bilateral distal radius, we demonstrated a strong correlation between the optical attenuation and BMD measured with DXA, which may facilitate predicting bone density status. We hope our potential NIR image system may open a new avenue for development of osteoporosis screening facilities and help in prevention of osteoporosis related fracture and its associated complications in the near future.

Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution that comprises a heterogeneous mixture of different particle sizes and chemical compositions. There are various sources of fine PM (PM 2.5 ), and the components may also have different effects on people. The pathogenesis of PM 2.5 in several diseases remains to be clarified. There is a long history of epidemiological research on PM 2.5 in several diseases. Numerous studies show that PM 2.5 can induce a variety of chronic diseases, such as respiratory system damage, cardiovascular dysfunction, and diabetes mellitus. However, the epidemiological evidence associated with potential mechanisms in the progression of diseases need to be proved precisely through in vitro and in vivo investigations. Suggested mechanisms of PM 2.5 that lead to adverse effects and chronic diseases include increasing oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and genotoxicity. The aim of this review is to provide a brief overview of in vitro and in vivo experimental studies of PM 2.5 in the progression of various diseases from the last decade. The summarized research results could provide clear information about the mechanisms and progression of PM 2.5 -induced disease. ? 2018 by the authors.

This is a population-based study using the claims dataset from The National Health Insurance Research Database. Methods: We included 72,642 patients with TBI aged over 20 years, retrospectively, selected from the longitudinal health insurance database during 2000–2010, according to the ICD-9-CM. The control group consisted of 217,872 patients without TBI that were randomly chosen from the database at a ratio of 1:3, with age- and index year matched. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate the association between the TBI and subsequent ED. Results: After a 10-year follow-up, the incidence rate of ED was higher in the TBI patients when compared with the non-TBI control group (24.66 and 19.07 per 100,000, respectively). Patients with TBI had a higher risk of developing ED than the non-TBI cohort after the adjustment of the confounding factors, such as age, comorbidity, residence of urbanization and locations, seasons, level of care, and insured premiums (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 2.569, 95% CI [1.890, 3.492], p <.001). Conclusion: This is the first study using a comprehensive nationwide database to analyze the association of ED and TBI in the Asian population. After adjusted the confounding factors, patients with TBI have a significantly higher risk of developing ED, especially organic ED, than the general population. This finding might remind clinicians that it’s crucial in early identification and treatment of ED in post-TBI patients. ? 2018, The Author(s) 2018.",epidemiology of men’s health; erectile dysfunction; general health and wellness; sexual disorders; sexual dysfunction; sexuality; traumatic brain injury,"adult; age distribution; aged; case control study; complication; erectile dysfunction; factual database; human; incidence; injury scale; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; proportional hazards model; retrospective study; risk assessment; Taiwan; traumatic brain injury; young adult; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Case-Control Studies; Databases, Factual; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Incidence; Injury Severity Score; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Taiwan; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85048991160

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to investigate the effects of Buerger’s exercise on dorsal foot skin circulation with novel technique of measuring the absorption difference in wavelength of light between oxy-hemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR). Patients with vasculopathic DFU who could tolerate Buerger’s exercise three times a day at home for at least 8?weeks were enrolled (group A). They were divided into two subgroups: without previous percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) (group A1) vs. with previous PTA (group A2). Wireless NIRS were applied on patients’ dorsal foot to assess the peripheral circulation in follow-up clinics. The patients’ wound condition, follow-up time, and concentration of HbO2 and total hemoglobin (HbT) before and after exercise rehabilitation program were documented. From May 2015 to February 2016, 14 patients with average age of 70.2 ± 11.2 were enrolled in this study (group A), including eight without previous PTA (group A1), and six with previous PTA (group A2).

An increasing number of social network mental disorders (SNMDs), such as Cyber-Relationship Addiction, Information Overload, and Net Compulsion, have been recently noted. Symptoms of these mental disorders are usually observed passively today, resulting in delayed clinical intervention. In this paper, we argue that mining online social behavior provides an opportunity to actively identify SNMDs at an early stage. It is challenging to detect SNMDs because the mental status cannot be directly observed from online social activity logs. Our approach, new and innovative to the practice of SNMD detection, does not rely on self-revealing of those mental factors via questionnaires in Psychology. Instead, we propose a machine learning framework, namely, Social Network Mental Disorder Detection (SNMDD), that exploits features extracted from social network data to accurately identify potential cases of SNMDs. We also exploit multi-source learning in SNMDD and propose a new SNMD-based Tensor Model (STM) to improve the accuracy. To increase the scalability of STM, we further improve the efficiency with performance guarantee. Our framework is evaluated via a user study with 3,126 online social network users. We conduct a feature analysis, and also apply SNMDD on large-scale datasets and analyze the characteristics of the three SNMD types. The results manifest that SNMDD is promising for identifying online social network users with potential SNMDs. ? 1989-2012 IEEE.",feature extraction; mental disorder detection; online social network; Tensor factorization acceleration,Data mining; Extraction; Feature extraction; Internet; Learning systems; Surveys; Tensile stress; Mental disorders; On-line social networks; Psychology; Social network services; Tensor factorization; Social networking (online),2-s2.0-85039809159

However, with the conventional approach of RIP data analysis, respiratory muscle effort cannot be estimated. In this paper, the estimation of the respiratory muscle effort through RIP signal was proposed. A complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition method was used, to extract hidden signals from the RIP signals based on the frequency bands of the activities of different respiratory muscles. To validate the proposed method, an experiment to collect subjects’ RIP signal under thoracic breathing (TB) and abdominal breathing (AB) was conducted.

In order to reduce the risk of amputation, Buerger's exercise is frequently used for rehabilitation to improve the blood circulation in lower limbs. However, it is difficult to evaluate the rehabilitation efficiency with Buerger's exercise objectively. In this study, a novel non-invasively optical system is developed to non-invasively monitor the change of the foot blood circulation before and after long-term Buerger's exercise. Radial basis function neural network is also used for classifying the healthy and diabetic groups from the change of relative total hemoglobin (HbT) concentration and tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) and providing an index to evaluate the rehabilitation efficiency with Buerger's exercise. Finally, the experimental results show that the relative HbT concentration and StO2 in lower limbs corresponding to different groups are significantly different and could be used as the factors for the classification of healthy subjects and diabetic foot patients. Moreover, the tendency of the relative HbT concentration and StO2 rise after the long-term rehabilitation with Buerger's exercise. ? 2013 IEEE.",Blood circulation; Buerger's exercise; diabetes; tissue oxygen saturation; total hemoglobin concentration,"Artificial limbs; Blood; Efficiency; Hemoglobin; Medical problems; Optical communication; Optical devices; Optical systems; Radial basis function networks; Tissue; Wireless telecommunication systems; Biomedical optical imaging; Blood circulation; Foot; Optical saturation; Tissue oxygen saturation; Total hemoglobins; Wireless communications; Hemoglobin oxygen saturation; hemoglobin; oxygen; oxyhemoglobin; hemoglobin; oxygen; aged; Article; Buerger exercise; clinical article; controlled study; diabetic foot; exercise; female; foot; hemoglobin determination; human; male; near infrared spectroscopy; percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; peripheral circulation; peripheral occlusive artery disease; tissue oxygenation; artificial neural network; blood; devices; diabetic foot; electronic device; kinesiotherapy; middle aged; physiologic monitoring; procedures; vascularization; Aged; Diabetic Foot; Exercise Therapy; Female; Foot; Hemoglobins; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Physiologic; Neural Networks (Computer); Oxygen; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared; Wearable Electronic Devices",2-s2.0-85028945454

However, due to the limitation of vaccine supply, it is usually impractical to vaccinate all of the people in a community. Therefore, how to smartly select a small group of people for targeted vaccination becomes an important issue. Recently, reference [3] deploys a wireless sensor system in a high school in China to collect contacts between students happened within a disease transmission distance. Reference [3] constructs a graph model for disease propagation and presents a measure of importance of nodes, called connectivity centrality, so that targeted vaccination can be performed effectively. We find that although connectivity centrality does provide a nice measure of how a node affects the other nodes during disease propagation, it overemphasizes the contact frequency between nodes and overlooks the number of neighbors of a node. Therefore, in this paper, we suggest a new measure of importance of nodes in disease-propagation graphs. and we show that there exist an infinite number of disease-propagation graphs such that the node selected by our measure is better than that selected by [3]. ? 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Disease containment; Graph; Node centrality; Node importance; Wireless sensor network,Cluster computing; Diseases; Graph theory; Vaccines; Wireless sensor networks; Contact frequency; Disease propagation; Disease transmission; Graph; Infectious disease; Node centralities; Node importance; Wireless sensor system; Sensor nodes,2-s2.0-85056624625

Conversely, hosts also transfer sRNAs into pathogens and pests to inhibit their virulence. Although sRNA trafficking has been observed in a wide variety of interactions, how sRNAs are transferred, especially from hosts to pathogens and pests, is still unknown. Here, we show that host Arabidopsis cells secrete exosome-like extracellular vesicles to deliver sRNAs into fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. These sRNA-containing vesicles accumulate at the infection sites and are taken up by the fungal cells. Transferred host sRNAs induce silencing of fungal genes critical for pathogenicity. Thus, Arabidopsis has adapted exosome-mediated cross-kingdom RNA interference as part of its immune responses during the evolutionary arms race with the pathogen. ? 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Methods: Overall, 535 consecutive HCC patients undergoing curative resection from 2010 to 2014 were followed and classified with early (ER, <2 years) or late recurrence (LR). Autophagy-related markers, LC3, Beclin-1, and p62 expression was immunohistochemically assessed in HCC and adjacent non-tumor (ANT) tissues. Results: HCC recurred in 245 patients: 116 with ER and 129 with LR. The cumulative incidence of recurrence at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years was 9.7%, 33.9%, 53.3%, and 66.3%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, HCC recurrence was significantly associated with low LC3 expression in tumor and ANT tissues, HCC tissues only and ANT tissues only (hazard ratio/95% confidence interval: 6.12/2.473-17.53, 4.18/1.285-13.61, and 1.89/1.299-2.757) and macrovascular invasion (1.63/1.043-2.492) and cirrhosis (1.59/1.088-2.326).

LR was significantly associated with low LC3 expression in tumor and ANT tissues, HCC tissues only and ANT tissues only (5.02/1.372-18.83, 3.19/1.13-12.09, and 1.66/1.051-2.620) and cirrhosis (1.66/1.049-2.631). Patients with low and high LC3 expression in tumor and ANT tissues showed a 5-year cumulative recurrence of 94.3% and 41.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The high LC3 expression in the tumor and liver microenvironments is significantly associated with lower HCC recurrence. Furthermore, tumor characteristics and liver microenvironment were also significantly associated with ER and LR, respectively. Translational impact: The analysis for LC3 expression in both the HCC and ANT tissues could identify patients at risk of HCC recurrence. ? 2018 The Author(s).",,"beclin 1; sequestosome 1; beclin 1; biological marker; light chain 3, human; microtubule associated protein; P62 protein, human; RNA binding protein; adult; Article; autophagy; cancer recurrence; carcinogenesis; female; gene; gene expression; human; LC3 gene; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver resection; major clinical study; male; priority journal; protein expression; retrospective study; tumor invasion; tumor microenvironment; aged; autophagy; chemistry; follow up; gene expression; genetics; liver; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; middle aged; pathology; prognosis; tumor microenvironment; tumor recurrence; Aged; Autophagy; Beclin-1; Biomarkers; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gene Expression; Hepatectomy; Humans; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; RNA-Binding Proteins; Tumor Microenvironment",2-s2.0-85049367890

Recently, we published a research article on gene expression profiling of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) that were exposed to ionizing radiation (IR). Single-dose irradiation of tumors could initiate differentially expressed genes in TAM as a time series from irradiated tumors that are associated with the immune response. It is also well known that human cancers are associated with microRNA (miRNA) alterations that are involved in cancer progression. However, the role of miRNA on TAM after exposure to irradiation remains unclear. Results: In this study, miRNA expression profiles from microarrays were used to identify the key miRNAs and correlating pathways involved in the role of TAMs in tumor progression and recurrence after RT. Using a mouse tumor model, we identified miRNA pattern changes over time in response to irradiation. Based on our results, we hypothesize that miRNA expression in the irradiated tumor may be used as a distinguishing marker to indicate the best time for therapeutic intervention to prevent tumor recurrence after RT. Conclusions: We established a murine model irradiated with a single dose of 25 Gy that could initiate temporal changes in the expression of miRNAs associated with cell proliferation and the immune response, as evidenced by macrophages directly extracted from irradiated tumors after two weeks of IR. Statistical analyses were conducted by comparing the miRNA expression in macrophages from non-irradiated versus irradiated tumors. Thus, our study could lead to a better understanding of the function of miRNA expressions, which changed temporally in an irradiated tumor microenvironment. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Microarray; microRNA; microRNA target interaction (MTI); Tumor microenvironment; Tumor-associated macrophages,"Cell proliferation; Diseases; Enzyme activity; Gene expression; Immune system; Ionizing radiation; Irradiation; Macrophages; Microarrays; Radiotherapy; Tumors; Cancer progression; Differentially expressed gene; Gene expression profiling; MicroRNAs; Therapeutic intervention; Tumor associated macrophages; Tumor microenvironment; Tumor progressions; RNA; messenger RNA; microRNA; animal; C57BL mouse; disease model; gamma radiation; gene expression profiling; genetics; macrophage; metabolism; mouse; neoplasm; pathology; radiation response; tumor cell culture; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Gamma Rays; Gene Expression Profiling; Macrophages; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; MicroRNAs; Neoplasms; RNA, Messenger; Tumor Cells, Cultured",2-s2.0-85044567481

However, not many studies have analyzed velocity differences between the groups during this task. This study aimed to examine differences between the groups related to this characteristic using a tablet. Fourteen PD, 12 ET, and 12 control group participants performed two tasks: tracing a given spiral (T1) and following a guiding point (T2). A digitized tablet was used to record movements and trajectory. Effects of direct visual feedback on intergroup and intragroup velocity were measured. Although PD patients had a significantly lower T1 velocity than the control group (p < 0.05), they could match the velocity of the guiding point (3.0?cm/s) in T2. There was no significant difference in the average T1 velocity between ET and the control groups (p = 0.26); however, the T2 velocity of ET patients was significantly higher than the control group (p < 0.05). They were also unable to adjust the velocity to match the guiding point, indicating that ET patients have a poorer ability to follow dynamic guidance. When both groups of patients have similar action tremor severity, their ability to follow dynamic guidance was still significantly different. Our study combined visual feedback with spiral drawing and demonstrated differences in the following-velocity distribution in PD and ET. This method may be used to distinguish the tremor presentation of both diseases, and thus, provide accurate diagnosis. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l., part of Springer Nature.",Essential tremor; Parkinson’s disease; Spiral drawing; Visual feedback,"adult; aged; Article; clinical article; controlled study; disease severity; drawing; essential tremor; eye hand coordination; eye tracking; human; middle aged; Parkinson disease; sensorimotor integration; spiral drawing; task performance; velocity; visual feedback; visuomotor coordination; biomechanics; comparative study; essential tremor; feedback system; hand; motor performance; Parkinson disease; pathophysiology; personal digital assistant; physiology; psychology; very elderly; vision; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomechanical Phenomena; Computers, Handheld; Essential Tremor; Feedback; Hand; Humans; Middle Aged; Motor Skills; Parkinson Disease; Visual Perception",2-s2.0-85044351031

Herein, electroencephalogram complexity before migraine attacks was examined using an inherent fuzzy entropy approach, allowing the development of an electroencephalogram-based classification model to recognize the difference between interictal and preictal phases. Methods: Forty patients with migraine without aura and 40 age-matched normal control subjects were recruited, and the resting-state electroencephalogram signals of their prefrontal and occipital areas were prospectively collected. The migraine phases were defined based on the headache diary, and the preictal phase was defined as within 72 hours before a migraine attack. Results: The electroencephalogram complexity of patients in the preictal phase, which resembled that of normal control subjects, was significantly higher than that of patients in the interictal phase in the prefrontal area (FDR-adjusted p < 0.05) but not in the occipital area. The measurement of test-retest reliability (n = 8) using the intra-class correlation coefficient was good with r1 = 0.73 (p = 0.01). Furthermore, the classification model, support vector machine, showed the highest accuracy (76 ± 4%) for classifying interictal and preictal phases using the prefrontal electroencephalogram complexity. Conclusion: Entropy-based analytical methods identified enhancement or “normalization” of frontal electroencephalogram complexity during the preictal phase compared with the interictal phase. This classification model, using this complexity feature, may have the potential to provide a preictal alert to migraine without aura patients. ? 2017, International Headache Society 2017.",classification; complexity; EEG; Migraine; resting-state,"accuracy; adult; Article; clinical article; controlled study; correlation coefficient; disease association; disease classification; disease course; electroencephalogram; entropy; female; human; male; migraine without aura; occipital cortex; prefrontal cortex; resting state network; support vector machine; test retest reliability; algorithm; brain; electroencephalography; middle aged; migraine; pathophysiology; procedures; rest; signal processing; Adult; Algorithms; Brain; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Migraine Disorders; Rest; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Support Vector Machine",2-s2.0-85043702084

In Taiwan, the relationship of the CRAB circulation between long-term care facilities (LTCFs) and acute care hospitals remains unclear. Here, we use molecular epidemiologic methods to describe the transmission of CRAB isolates between a community hospital and its affiliated LTCFs. Methods: Subjects localized in eight LTCFs who were not admitted acute care hospitals in recent a year were enrolled in this study. CRAB isolates were collected during June 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015. DNA fingerprinting was performed by repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (Rep-PCR) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Multiplex-PCR amplification for the detection of blaOXA genes and beta-lactamase genes was performed. Results: Twenty one subjects were enrolled. The major hospital admission diagnoses among the 21 subjects were pneumonia (71.4%). Genotyping of CRAB isolates by Rep-PCR revealed that a major clone, designated as type III, comprised fifteen of 21 (71.4%) isolates taken from 5 LTCFs and one study hospital. The isolates with type III were subtyped by PubMLST into 4 ST types. The most prevalent blaOXA genes in these isolates were blaOXA-23-like (85.70%, 18/21). Twenty isolates carried blaSHV. Conclusion: Clonal spread of blaOxA-23-carrying CRABs was found around LTCFs and the affiliated hospital. In Taiwan, it is important for the government to focus attention on the importance of identifying and tracing CRAB infections in LTCFs. ? 2017",A community hospital; Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii; Long-term care facilities,"Acinetobacter baumannii; Acinetobacter infection; adult; aged; Article; bacteremia; bacterial colonization; bacterium culture; bacterium isolate; carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii; chronic obstructive lung disease; community hospital; cross-sectional study; DNA extraction; DNA fingerprinting; emergency care; female; gene amplification; hospital admission; hospital infection; human; infection risk; long term care; major clinical study; male; medical record; multilocus sequence typing; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; pneumonia; polymerase chain reaction; risk assessment; Taiwan; urinary tract infection; Acinetobacter baumannii; Acinetobacter infection; drug effect; genetics; genotype; genotyping technique; isolation and purification; long term care; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; middle aged; molecular epidemiology; multidrug resistance; pathogenicity; procedures; prospective study; transmission; very elderly; antiinfective agent; bacterial DNA; bacterial protein; beta lactamase; beta-lactamase OXA-23, Acinetobacter baumannii; carbapenem derivative; Acinetobacter baumannii; Acinetobacter Infections; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacterial Proteins; beta-Lactamases; Carbapenems; Cross-Sectional Studies; DNA Fingerprinting; DNA, Bacterial; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Female; Genotype; Genotyping Techniques; Hospitals, Community; Humans; Long-Term Care; Male; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Middle Aged; Molecular Epidemiology; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction; Prospective Studies; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85027572691

Methods: In this study, we developed a size-changeable “Trojan Horse” nanocarrier (THNC) composed of paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded Greek soldiers (GSs; ~20 nm) assembled in an amphiphilic gelatin matrix with hydrophilic losartan (LST) added. Results: With amphiphilic gelatin matrix cleavage by matrix metalloproteinase-2, LST showed fast release of up to 60% accumulated drug at 6 h, but a slow release kinetic (~20%) was detected in the PTX from the GSs, indicating that THNCs enable controllable release of LST and PTX drugs for penetration into the tumor tissue. The in vitro cell viability in a 3D tumor spheroid model indicated that the PTX-loaded GSs liberated from THNCs showed deeper penetration as well as higher cytotoxicity, reducing a tumor spheroid to half its original size and collapsing the structure of the tumor microenvironment. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that the THNCs with controlled drug release and deep penetration of magnetic GSs show great potential for cancer therapy. ? 2018 Wang et al.",Amphiphilic gelatin; Controlled release; Deep tumor penetration; Nanocarriers,"gelatin; nanocarrier; quantum dot; antineoplastic agent; gelatin; losartan; nanoparticle; paclitaxel; polyethylene derivative; polypropylene; UCON 50-HB-5100; Article; cell viability; centrifugation; confocal laser scanning microscopy; controlled study; cytotoxicity; degradation; drug delivery system; drug penetration; extracellular matrix; human; human cell; hydrophilicity; image quality; morphology; nanoencapsulation; nanomedicine; particle size; photon correlation spectroscopy; scanning electron microscopy; tumor microenvironment; tumor spheroid; chemical phenomena; chemistry; delayed release formulation; drug delivery system; drug effect; HeLa cell line; multicellular spheroid; nanomedicine; pathology; procedures; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Cell Line, Tumor; Delayed-Action Preparations; Drug Delivery Systems; Gelatin; HeLa Cells; Humans; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Losartan; Nanomedicine; Nanoparticles; Paclitaxel; Polyethylenes; Polypropylenes; Spheroids, Cellular; Tumor Microenvironment",2-s2.0-85047948865

To monitor the PM2.5, the Airbox project that consists of more than 2000 PM2.5 sensors is executing in Taiwan. Thanks to the Airbox sensors, people can know the fine-grained air quality. However, Airbox sensors can fail and it is important to detect which sensor is failed to prevent the noise in the data. In this work, we focus on fault detection and value estimation for PM2.5 monitoring. To achieve our goal, we utilize the data from Environmental Protection Administration(EPA) for estimation. We firstly propose two estimation methods which consider the distance and similarity between the Airbox sensors and EPA monitoring stations for PM2.5 estimation. Then based on the estimation result, we detect which sensors is failed. We collect the data from Airbox Edimax web page and Taiwan's Environmental Protection Administration for our experiment.

Hence, studies of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte populations (TILs) are key to the success of advanced treatments. In addition to laboratory methods such as immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, in silico gene expression deconvolution methods are available for analyses of relative proportions of immune cell types. Results: Herein, we used microarray data from the public domain to profile gene expression pattern of twenty-two immune cell types. Initially, outliers were detected based on the consistency of gene profiling clustering results and the original cell phenotype notation. Subsequently, we filtered out genes that are expressed in non-hematopoietic normal tissues and cancer cells. For every pair of immune cell types, we ran t-tests for each gene, and defined differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from this comparison. Equal numbers of DEGs were then collected as candidate lists and numbers of conditions and minimal values for building signature matrixes were calculated. Finally, we used v -Support Vector Regression to construct a deconvolution model. The performance of our system was finally evaluated using blood biopsies from 20 adults, in which 9 immune cell types were identified using flow cytometry. The present computations performed better than current state-of-the-art deconvolution methods.

The aim of this study was to examine our eight years' experience of surgical treatment in patients with IMR, and to compare outcomes of mitral valve repair versus replacement with concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Methods: A retrospective, observational, cohort study was undertaken to collect data on consecutive patients with IMR and coronary artery disease who received CABG and mitral valve surgery in our hospital between January 2008 and December 2015. Basic patient characteristics, operative data, and postoperative clinical outcomes were examined. Results: The series included 22 consecutive patients (21 male; 1 female). The mean age was 62.1±11.4 years old. The mean preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 33.4%±15.4%. The mean cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time was 165.4±38.4 minutes, and the mean aortic cross clamp time was 113.8±33.6 minutes. Eighteen patients underwent CABG plus mitral valve repair, and four patients underwent CABG plus mitral valve replacement (MVR). There were three early in-hospital mortalities: two in the mitral valve repair group, and one in the replacement group. The follow-up was complete in all patients, with a mean follow-up duration of 3.1±2.3 years. The mean last LVEF was 35.3%±17.7%. There were 2 late mortalities. Both were from the repair group. The overall late survival rate was 81.6%, with 83.0% in the repair group and 75.0% in the replacement group. In patients with echocardiography follow-up of more than or equal to 1 year duration, the residual or recurrent mitral regurgitation rates were 0.0% in the replacement group and 57.1% in the repair group. One patient in the repair group later underwent MVR due to severe regurgitation postoperatively. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings showed that the surgical outcome of mitral valve repair might be comparable to that of MVR in terms of early mortality and long-term survival. However, mitral valve repair was associated with a higher residual or recurrent mitral regurgitation rate. According to the latest literature, the role of MVR can justifiably be indicated for severe IMR. As for moderate IMR, CABG alone without mitral valve intervention may provide similar clinical outcomes. ?

Gastric cancer is often diagnosed at advanced stages and the outcome of the treatment is often poor. Therefore, identifying new therapeutic targets for this cancer is urgently needed. Integrin alpha 2 (ITGA2) subunit and the beta 1 subunit form a heterodimer for a transmembrane receptor for extracellular matrix, is an important molecule involved in tumor cell proliferation, survival and migration. Integrin α2β1 is over-expressed on a variety of cancer cells, but is low or absent in most normal organs and resting endothelial cells. Results: In this report, we assessed the ITGA2 as the potential therapeutic target with the bioinformatics tools from the TCGA dataset in which composed of 375 gastric cancer tissues and 32 gastric normal tissues. According to the information from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database, the AGS cell line with ITGA2 high expression and the SUN-1 cell line with low expression were chosen for the further investigation. Interestingly, the anti-ITGA2 antibody (at 3 μg/ml) inhibited approximately 50% survival of the AGS cells (over-expressed ITGA2), but had no effect in SNU-1 cells (ITGA2 negative). The extents of antibody-mediated cancer inhibition positively correlated with the expression levels of the ITGA2. We further showed that the anti-ITGA2 antibody induced apoptosis by up-regulating the RhoA-p38 MAPK signaling to promote the expressions of Bim, Apaf-1 and Caspase-9, whereas the expressions of Ras and Bax/Bcl-2 were not affected. Moreover, blocking ITGA2 by the specific antibody at lower doses also inhibited cell migration of gastric cancer cells. Blockade of ITGA2 by a specific antibody down-regulated the expression of N-WASP, PAK and LIMK to impede actin organization and cell migration of gastric cancer cells. Conclusions: Here, we showed that the mRNA expression levels of ITGA2 comparing to normal tissues significantly increased. In addition, the results revealed that targeting integrin alpha 2 subunit by antibodies did not only inhibit cell migration, but also induce apoptosis effect on gastric cancer cells. Interestingly, higher expression level of ITGA2 led to significant effects on apoptosis progression during anti-ITGA2 antibody treatment, which indicated that ITGA2 expression levels directly correlate with their functionality. Our findings suggest that ITGA2 is a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Apoptosis; Cell migration; Gastric cancer; Integrin alpha-2; ITGA2; Proliferation; Therapeutic target,alpha2 integrin; apoptotic protease activating factor 1; BIM protein; caspase 9; LIM kinase; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; neural Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein; protein Cdc42; Rac1 protein; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; actin polymerization; apoptosis; Article; cancer cell; cancer inhibition; cancer tissue; cell count; cell membrane; cell migration; cell proliferation; controlled study; down regulation; gene overexpression; human; human cell; protein expression; protein function; SNU-1 cell line; stomach cancer; stomach tissue,2-s2.0-85046274837

Methods: We searched the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005 to retrieve patients’ medical records from 1996 to 2009. The patients with KD were categorized as living in northern, middle, and southern Taiwan; the period prevalence of KD for each area was determined. Climate variables, including temperature, sunshine duration, precipitation, and relative humidity, were collected from the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau. The effect of latitude on the period KD prevalence and the correlation between climate variables and KD prevalence were calculated. Results: After patients without complete data excluded, a total of 61,830 children up to 10 years old were retrieved, from which 404 patients with KD were recognized. The period prevalence of KD increased significantly with latitude (p = 0.0004). Climate variables associated with high temperature demonstrated a connection with KD prevalence; however, this correlation was not statistically significant.

In order to seek genetic mechanisms that initiate and progress ALS, the association of microRNA (miRNA) expression with this disease was considered. Serum miRNAs from healthy controls, sporadic ALS (sALS), familial ALS (fALS) and ALS mutation carriers were investigated. Principal component analysis (PCA)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) was applied to these serum miRNA profiles. As a result, we predict miRNAs that can discriminate patients from healthy controls with high accuracy. Thus, these miRNAs can be potential prognosis miRNA biomarkers for ALS. ? 2018 by the authors.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the role of IKAS in long-term CM. Methods: CM was created with 3–5 weeks of ventricular pacing and defined by a flat or inverted T wave off pacing. Epicardial optical mapping was performed in both paced and normal ventricles. Action potential duration (APD80) was determined during right atrial pacing. Ventricular stability was tested before and after IKAS blockade. Four paced hearts and 4 normal hearts were used for western blotting and histology. Results: There were no significant differences in either echocardiographic parameters or fibrosis levels between groups. Apamin induced more APD80 prolongation in CM than in normal ventricles (mean [95% confidence interval]: 9.6% [8.8%–10.5%] vs 3.1% [1.9%–4.3%]; P &lt;.001). Apamin significantly lengthened APD80 in the CM model at late activation sites, indicating significant IKAS up-regulation at those sites. The CM model also had altered Ca2+ handling, with the 50% Ca2+ transient duration and amplitude increased at distal sites compared to a proximal site (near the pacing site). After apamin, the CM model had increased ventricular fibrillation (VF) inducibility (paced vs control: 33/40 (82.5%) vs 7/20 (35%); P &lt;.001) and longer VF durations (124 vs 26 seconds; P &lt;.001). Conclusion: Chronic ventricular pacing increases Ca2+ transients at late activation sites, which activates IKAS to maintain repolarization reserve.

In this study, UFNPs with 2–10 nm diameter were removed by SBA-15 mesoporous silica molecular sieves with different pore sizes, and the filtration mechanism was analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), specific surface area tests (BET), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The analyses showed a distinctive filtration of UFNPs over the interior mesopore channels. The removal efficiencies of SBA-15 with different pore sizes were also compared, demonstrating the influence of the pore size and structure on most penetrating particle size (MPPS). The UFNP filtration efficiency of SBA-15 increased with the increase of pore size.

However, a gene that is specifically expressed in the tumor area has not been identified. In addition, nonspecific expression of therapeutic genes in normal tissues may cause side effects that can harm the patients' health. Certain promoters have been reported to drive therapeutic gene expression specifically in cancer cells; however, low expression levels of the target gene are a problem for providing good therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, a specific and highly expressive promoter is needed for cancer gene therapy. Methods: Bioinformatics approaches were utilized to analyze transcription factors (TFs) from high-throughput data. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and cell transfection were applied for the measurement of mRNA, protein expression and activity. C57BL/6JNarl mice were injected with pD5-hrGFP to evaluate the expression of TFs. Results: We analyzed bioinformatics data and identified three TFs, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-ΚB), cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB), and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), that are highly active in tumor cells. Here, we constructed a novel mini-promoter, D5, that is composed of the binding sites of the three TFs. The results show that the D5 promoter specifically drives therapeutic gene expression in tumor tissues and that the strength of the D5 promoter is directly proportional to tumor size. Conclusions: Our results show that bioinformatics may be a good tool for the selection of appropriate TFs and for the design of specific mini-promoters to improve cancer gene therapy. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Gene therapy; HIF-1α; NF-ΚB and CREB; Transcription factor,"cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; green fluorescent protein; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; messenger RNA; protein binding; transcription factor; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; binding site; bioinformatics; cancer gene therapy; controlled study; CREB gene; female; gene expression profiling; HIF1a gene; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; limit of quantitation; mouse; NFkB gene; nonhuman; promoter region; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; tumor volume; Western blotting; animal; biology; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene vector; genetics; metabolism; neoplasm; procedures; protein analysis; reporter gene; transgene; transgenic mouse; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Computational Biology; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genes, Reporter; Genetic Vectors; Humans; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Neoplasms; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Binding; Protein Interaction Mapping; Transcription Factors; Transgenes",2-s2.0-85046125981

There have been reports that allergic diseases were associated with depression or anxiety disorders. This study aimed to investigate the association between these allergic diseases and the risk of developing overall psychiatric disorders in patients from Taiwan. Methods: This cohort study used the database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program. A total of 186,588 enrolled patients, with 46,647 study subjects who had suffered from allergic diseases, and 139,941 controls matched for sex and age, from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Dataset of 2000-2015, were selected from a sub-dataset of the National Health Insurance Research Database. Fine and Gray's competing risk model analysis was used to explore the hazard ratio (HR), and 95% confidence interval, for the risk of allergic diseases being associated with the risk of developing psychiatric disorders during the 15 years of follow-up. Results: Of the study subjects, 5,038 (10.8%) developed psychiatric disorders when compared to 9,376 (6.7%) in the control group, with significant difference (p < 0.001). Fine and Gray's competing risk model analysis revealed that the adjusted HR was 1.659 (95% CI = 1.602-1.717, p < 0.001). In this study, we found that the groups of atopic dermatitis alone and the allergic rhinitis + atopic dermatitis were associated with a lower risk of psychiatric disorders, but all the other four groups, such as bronchial asthma alone, allergic rhinitis alone, bronchial asthma + allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma + atopic dermatitis, and the combination of all these three allergic diseases, were associated with a higher risk of psychiatric disorders. Conclusion: Allergic diseases are therefore associated with a 1.66-fold increased hazard of psychiatric disorders in Taiwan. ? 2018 Tzeng, Chang, Chung, Kao, Chang, Yeh, Chiang, Chou, Chang and Chien.",Allergic rhinitis; Atopic dermatitis; Bronchial asthma; Cohort study; National Health Insurance Research Database; Psychiatric disorders; Risk factors; Taiwan National Health Insurance Program,adult; allergic rhinitis; anxiety disorder; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; cohort analysis; controlled study; depression; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; mental disease; population research; risk; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85046653407

Thus, purification of BP from complex herb extract samples is important. In this study, we develop a facile method for selective purification of BP from complex samples by using iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) immobilized with riboflavin-5′-phosphate (RFMP) as affinity probes. RFMP is a polyaromatic compound that contains a phosphate, which can readily chelate with the metal center on the surface of Fe3O4 MNPs. The aromatic rings on RFMP can interact with BP (Kd = ?6.73 × 10-5 M) through π-π stacking. Thus, Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs are fabricated by simply mixing Fe3O4 MNPs with RFMP under microwave heating (power: 540 W) for 3 min. The as-prepared Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs can be used as affinity probes to selectively concentrate BP from an acidic solution; BP is then released from the MNPs by using acetonitrile. The recovery of BP from the Fe3O4@RFMP MNP-BP conjugates is estimated to be ?100%. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of using the proposed approach to selectively extract BP from complex A. sinensis extract samples. ? 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Drug delivery; Extraction; Magnetite; Microwave heating; Nanomagnetics; Nanoparticles; Probes; Purification; Acidic solutions; Active compounds; Angelica sinensis; Anticancer drug; Complex samples; Magnetic nano-particles; Selective extraction; Selective purification; Iron oxides,2-s2.0-85045118123

The role of the physical framework of the TME in guiding cells toward EMT is poorly understood. To investigate this, breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were cultured on nanochips comprising tantalum oxide nanodots ranging in diameter from 10 to 200 nm, fabricated through electrochemical approach and collectively referred to as artificial microenvironments. The 100 and 200 nm nanochips induced the cells to adopt an elongated or spindle-shaped morphology. The key EMT genes, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin, displayed the spatial control exhibited by the artificial microenvironments. The E-cadherin gene expression was attenuated, whereas those of N-cadherin and vimentin were amplified by 100 and 200 nm nanochips, indicating the induction of EMT. Transcription factors, snail and twist, were identified for modulating the EMT genes in the cells on these artificial microenvironments. Localization of EMT proteins observed through immunostaining indicated the loss of cell-cell junctions on 100 and 200 nm nanochips, confirming the EMT induction. Thus, by utilizing an in vitro approach, we demonstrate how the physical framework of the TME may possibly trigger or assist in inducing EMT in vivo.

Methods: This retrospective study identified very elderly (> 85 years) patients, who were medically managed, with their first AMI from the Taiwan National Health Insurance claims database from 2007 to 2010. Patients were classified as dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) group, aspirin only group and clopidogrel only group. Study outcomes included all-cause death, cardiovascular death and gastrointestinal bleeding. Treating DAPT group as the reference, we employed a multivariable Cox regression model to compare the relative risks of outcomes between 3 groups using pairwise comparison approach. Results: Among 1469 patients with incident ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, 14%) or non-STEMI (86%), 390 patients were prescribed DAPT, 549 aspirin only, and 530 clopidogrel only. After 9 months of follow-up, aspirin only group had similar risks of all-cause death (adjusted HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.77-1.89, p = 0.41), cardiovascular death (adjusted HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.66-2.04, p = 0.60) and gastrointestinal bleeding (adjusted HR 1.66, 95% CI 0.77-3.57, p = 0.20) in comparison with DAPT group. Clopidogrel users had a higher risk of all-cause death (adjusted HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.00-2.25, p = 0.049) but similar risks of cardiovascular death and gastrointestinal bleeding when compared with DAPT. Conclusions: Among very elderly patients who were medically managed after AMI, single antiplatelet therapy had comparable protective effect as DAPT.

Material and methods: We performed a population-based cohort study on adults using a National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) dataset. Hypertension and comparison non-hypertensive (COMP) groups comprising 39,618 patients each were propensity score-matched by age, sex, index date, and medical comorbidities. The outcome was incident UB cancer validated using procedure codes. We constructed multivariable Cox models to derive adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Cumulative incidence was compared using a log-rank test. Results: During a total follow-up duration of 380,525 and 372,020 person-years in the hypertension and COMP groups, 248 and 186 patients developed UB cancer, respectively, representing a 32% increase in the risk (aHR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.09–1.60). Hypertensive women harbored a significantly increased risk of UB cancer (aHR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.12–2.13) compared with non-hypertensive women, whereas men with hypertension had a statistically non-significant increased risk (aHR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.96–1.55). The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the increased risk was sustained throughout different follow-up durations for the entire cohort; a statistical increase in the risk was also noted among hypertensive men.

Methods: Normal sonograms from cerebral ultrasonographic examinations of 1- to 6-month-old healthy full-term infants were selected. The length and thickness of the corpus callosum were determined, and the effect of sex on these values was analyzed. Studies on corpus callosum sexual dimorphism were reviewed. Results: In total, sonograms from 236 1- to 6-month-old infants (120 male and 116 female) were collected, and the typical values (5th–95th percentiles) of the corpus callosum were determined for each group. During the first 2 months, with and without brain size adjustment, the corpus callosum in female infants was significantly thicker than that in male infants (mean thickness ± SD: 1 month, male infant, 1.8 ± 0.3 mm; female infant, 2.1 ± 0.3 mm; P =.005; 2 months, male infant, 1.8 ± 0.2 mm; female infant, 2.0 ± 0.3 mm; P =.002). The corpus callosum thickness of male and female infants had no significant differences after 2 months of age. Sexual dimorphism was not detected in corpus callosum length. Conclusions: Our study provides reference data on typical corpus callosum development in infants. In the fetal period and early infancy, the corpus callosum in female infants is thicker than that in male infants. From 3 months onward, the corpus callosum sexual dimorphism becomes insignificant throughout childhood. The evolvement of corpus callosum sexual dimorphism suggests that maternal factors may influence brain development. ? 2017 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine",brain development; cerebral ultrasonography; corpus callosum; infant; neurosonology (pediatric); sexual dimorphism,Radiology; Ultrasonics; Brain development; Corpus callosum; infant; neurosonology (pediatric); Sexual dimorphism; Brain; article; boy; brain development; brain size; child; controlled study; corpus callosum; echography; female; fetus; girl; human; infancy; infant; male; sex difference; thickness; anatomy and histology; child development; corpus callosum; echography; physiology; procedures; reference value; sex factor; Child Development; Corpus Callosum; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Reference Values; Sex Factors; Ultrasonography,2-s2.0-85050813537

Since the state of complexity of human beings is significantly affected by their health state, developing accurate complexity evaluation algorithms is a crucial and urgent area of study. This paper proposes using inherent fuzzy entropy (Inherent FuzzyEn) and its multiscale version, which employs empirical mode decomposition and fuzzy membership function (exponential function) to address the dynamic complexity in electroencephalogram (EEG) data. In the literature, the reliability of entropy-based complexity evaluations has been limited by superimposed trends in signals and a lack of multiple time scales. Our proposed method represents the first attempt to use the Inherent FuzzyEn algorithm to increase the reliability of complexity evaluation in realistic EEG applications. We recorded the EEG signals of several subjects under resting condition, and the EEG complexity was evaluated using approximate entropy, sample entropy, FuzzyEn, and Inherent FuzzyEn, respectively. The results indicate that Inherent FuzzyEn is superior to other competing models regardless of the use of fuzzy or nonfuzzy structures, and has the most stable complexity and smallest root mean square deviation. ? 2017 IEEE.",Complexity; electroencephalogram (EEG); empirical mode decomposition (EMD); entropy; fuzzy,Electroencephalography; Entropy; Exponential functions; Function evaluation; Membership functions; Signal processing; Complexity; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Electroencephalogram (EEG) datum; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Evaluation algorithm; fuzzy; Fuzzy membership function; Root mean square deviations; Computational complexity,2-s2.0-85045006892

However, more detailed knowledge of the underlying mechanism is needed to enable targeted intervention. Here, we show that paraspeckle component 1 (PSPC1), identified in an aberrant 13q12.11 locus, is upregulated and associated with poor survival in patients with cancer. PSPC1 promotes tumorigenesis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stemness and metastasis in multiple cell types and in spontaneous mouse cancer models. PSPC1 is the master activator for transcription factors of EMT and stemness and accompanies c-Myc activation to facilitate tumour growth. PSPC1 increases transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) secretion through an interaction with phosphorylated and nuclear Smad2/3 to potentiate TGF-β1 autocrine signalling. Moreover, PSPC1 acts as a contextual determinant of the TGF-β1 pro-metastatic switch to alter Smad2/3 binding preference from tumour-suppressor to pro-metastatic genes. Having validated the PSPC1-Smads-TGF-β1 axis in various cancers, we conclude that PSPC1 is a master activator of pro-metastatic switches and a potential target for anti-metastasis drugs. ? 2018 The Author(s).",,"cell protein; cisplatin; doxorubicin; fluorouracil; Myc protein; paclitaxel; paraspeckle component 1 protein; Smad2 protein; Smad3 protein; transforming growth factor beta1; unclassified drug; uvomorulin; vimentin; Myc protein; MYC protein, human; nuclear protein; paraspeckle protein 1, mouse; PSPC1 protein, human; RNA binding protein; Smad2 protein; SMAD2 protein, human; Smad3 protein; SMAD3 protein, human; TGFB1 protein, human; transforming growth factor beta1; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; autocrine effect; cancer survival; carcinogenesis; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; cellular, subcellular and molecular biological phenomena and functions; controlled study; down regulation; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; gene; gene expression; gene identification; gene knockdown; genetic correlation; genetic transcription; human; human cell; human tissue; lung metastasis; male; metastasis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; protein expression; protein function; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; protein secretion; PSPC1 gene; stemness; therapy resistance; tumor growth; upregulation; A-549 cell line; animal; cancer stem cell; cell motion; gene expression regulation; genetics; HEK293 cell line; metabolism; metastasis; neoplasm; nonobese diabetic mouse; nude mouse; pathology; phenotype; phosphorylation; SCID mouse; signal transduction; time factor; A549 Cells; Animals; Autocrine Communication; Cell Movement; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Male; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, Nude; Mice, SCID; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasms; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Nuclear Proteins; PC-3 Cells; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; RNA-Binding Proteins; Signal Transduction; Smad2 Protein; Smad3 Protein; Time Factors; Transforming Growth Factor beta1",2-s2.0-85044542236

The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) was used to evaluate the symptom severity of FM and Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI) was used to evaluate the severities depression symptoms in study participants. Five regions of interests (ROIs) were defined: the frontal-, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and temporal regions. Brain activities of ROIs between the two groups were compared. In addition, we investigated the relationship between clinical symptoms and brain cortical activity in FM patients. Our results showed that there were no significant differences between HC and FM patients in age, sex, and BDI scores. We found significantly reduced brain activity over the frontal regions during a VFT in FM patients (p =.026). In addition, we found decreased frontal activity was associated with BDI scores (rho = ?0.755, p =.007). Furthermore, there were no significant correlations between frontal activity and FIQ subscales. In conclusion, our study demonstrated a reduced frontal cortical activity during VFT in FM patients, and that NIRS could be a potential tool for evaluating brain function in FM patients in clinical settings. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Brain dysfunction; Cognition; Fibromyalgia; Near infrared spectroscopy; NIRS,"adult; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; brain electrophysiology; brain function; clinical article; controlled study; correlational study; disease severity; educational status; female; fibromyalgia; Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire; frontal cortex; human; inferior frontal gyrus; male; middle aged; near infrared spectroscopy; priority journal; speech test; temporal cortex; depression; fibromyalgia; frontal lobe; near infrared spectroscopy; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; psychology; verbal behavior; Adult; Depression; Female; Fibromyalgia; Frontal Lobe; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared; Verbal Behavior",2-s2.0-85043584507

In addition to progressive proximal muscle weakness, respiratory, orthopedic, and gastrointestinal complications are often observed in DMD. The natural history of patients with DMD in Taiwan has not been reported thus far. Methods: Medical records of 39 patients who received a diagnosis of DMD between 1999 and 2016 at Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital were reviewed. The diagnosis of DMD was confirmed through muscle biopsy or DMD genetic analysis. Results: The mean onset age and mean follow-up period were 2.75 years and 6.76 years, respectively. Seventeen patients (43.5%) had a family history of DMD. The mean full intelligence quotient of the patients was 71.08, and the mean age of walking ability loss was 9.7 years (25 patients). The mean onset age of respiratory insufficiency was 10.64 years with a decline rate of 5.18% per year (25 patients). The mean onset age of cardiomyopathy was 14.69 years (seven patients). The mean onset age of scoliosis was 13.29 years with a progression rate of 11.48° per year (14 patients). Eleven (28.2%) and eight (20.5%) patients had deletions and duplications of DMD, respectively. Fourteen patients (35.9%) had point mutations or small deletions or insertions. Five patients received only multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis and exhibited neither deletion nor duplication. No mutation was identified in one patient through both MLPA and exon sequencing. Conclusion: The clinical phenotypes and disease course in our cohort were consistent with that reported in previous studies. However, the proportion of point mutations or small deletions or insertions in our study was considerably higher than that in reports from other populations. Cardiac ejection fraction was found not a reliable biomarker for identifying cardiac problems, discovering a better parameter is necessary. ? 2017",corticosteroid; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; natural history; Taiwan,"prednisolone; corticosteroid; adolescent; Article; cardiomyopathy; clinical article; Cobb angle; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; corticosteroid therapy; disease exacerbation; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; exon; family history; female; follow up; forced vital capacity; gene deletion; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genotype phenotype correlation; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; human; intelligence quotient; male; medical record review; molecular pathology; multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification; muscle biopsy; neuropathology; onset age; point mutation; respiratory failure; retrospective study; scoliosis; Taiwan; walking; child; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; genetics; genotype; mutation; phenotype; preschool child; Adolescent; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Gene Deletion; Genotype; Humans; Male; Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne; Mutation; Phenotype; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-85028957784

Despite the availability of large-scale methods for analyzing PPI networks, these methods often focused on PPI networks using genome-scale data and/or known experimental PPIs. However, these methods are unable to provide structurally resolved interaction residues and their conservations in PPI networks. Results: Here, we reconstructed a human three-dimensional (3D) structural PPI network (hDiSNet) with the detailed atomic binding models and disease-associated mutations by enhancing our PPI families and 3D-domain interologs from 60,618 structural complexes and complete genome database with 6,352,363 protein sequences across 2274 species. hDiSNet is a scale-free network (γ = 2.05), which consists of 5177 proteins and 19,239 PPIs with 5843 mutations. These 19,239 structurally resolved PPIs not only expanded the number of PPIs compared to present structural PPI network, but also achieved higher agreement with gene ontology similarities and higher co-expression correlation than the ones of 181,868 experimental PPIs recorded in public databases. Among 5843 mutations, 1653 and 790 mutations involved in interacting domains and contacting residues, respectively, are highly related to diseases. Our hDiSNet can provide detailed atomic interactions of human disease and their associated proteins with mutations. Our results show that the disease-related mutations are often located at the contacting residues forming the hydrogen bonds or conserved in the PPI family. In addition, hDiSNet provides the insights of the FGFR (EGFR)-MAPK pathway for interpreting the mechanisms of breast cancer and ErbB signaling pathway in brain cancer. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that hDiSNet can explore structural-based interactions insights for understanding the mechanisms of disease-associated proteins and their mutations. We believe that our method is useful to reconstruct structurally resolved PPI networks for interpreting structural genomics and disease associations. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Disease-associated proteins with mutations; Homologous mapping method; Structural systems biology; Structurally resolved PPI networks,"EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; fibroblast growth factor 2; breast tumor; diseases; genetics; human; MAPK signaling; metabolism; mutation; pathology; procedures; protein analysis; sequence homology; Breast Neoplasms; Disease; ErbB Receptors; Fibroblast Growth Factor 2; Humans; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mutation; Protein Interaction Mapping; Sequence Homology",2-s2.0-85044173748

No standard drawing methods and parameters that use graphic tablets are yet available for objective evaluation. Methods: This study established a tremor assessment system for tremor severity by using graphic tablets. Twelve patients with ET and twelve patients with PD were tested to establish system algorithms, and six additional patients were tested with the developed system to evaluate its performance. The patients also performed spiral drawing with three guiding paradigms on a graphic tablet: traced along a given spiral (S1), performed freehand drawing (S2), and traced along a guiding point (S3). Three parameters were calculated to quantify tremor severity: the means of radial difference per radian (dr/dθ), the means of radial difference per second (dr/dt), and the area under curve (AUC) of the frequency spectrum of the velocity. Each patient's drawing was also evaluated using a visual rating scale (VRS) by experienced physicians. The interrater reliability was examined to identify the most consistent test paradigm. Results: The parameter dr/dθ and AUC correlated well with the VRS (R > 0.8) in S1, S2 and S3 tests. The S1 test presented the best interrater reliability (Weighted Kappa coefficient, k = 0.80) among three tests. The Weighted Kappa coefficients are 0.67 and 0.71 in S2 and S3 tests, respectively. Conclusions: We developed three different guiding paradigms for spiral drawing on a digital graphic tablet for clinical tests. Three parameters were calculated to represent the tremor severity in spiral drawing and used to quantify temporal and spatial characteristics of tremor, and provided good correlation with current clinical assessments. The test ""traced along a given spiral"" is recommended due to its good interrater reliability. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Clinical assessment; Essential tremor; Parkinson's disease; Spiral drawing,"aged; area under the curve; Article; clinical article; clinical assessment tool; correlation coefficient; disease severity assessment; drawing; essential tremor; human; interrater reliability; Parkinson disease; rating scale; spiral drawing test; task performance; velocity; visual rating scale; complication; essential tremor; female; male; middle aged; motor performance; neurologic examination; Parkinson disease; personal digital assistant; procedures; reproducibility; tremor; Aged; Computers, Handheld; Essential Tremor; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Skills; Neurologic Examination; Parkinson Disease; Reproducibility of Results; Tremor",2-s2.0-85043467425

The use of a nonequilibrium low-temperature atmospheric-pressure plasma jet (APPJ) has been demonstrated to exert selective effects in cancer therapy and to be able to enhance the uptake of molecules by cells, which makes an APPJ a good candidate adjuvant in combination chemotherapy. This study estimated the effects of direct helium-based APPJ (He-APPJ) exposure (DE) and He-APPJ-activated RPMI medium (PAM) on cell viability and migration. Both of these treatments decreased cell viability and inhibited cell migration, but to different degrees in different cell types. The use of PAM as a culture medium resulted in the dialkylcarbocyanine (DiI) fluorescent dye entering the cells more efficiently. PAM was combined with the anticancer drug doxorubicin (Doxo) to treat human heptocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells and human adenocarcinomic alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells. The results showed that the synergistic effects of combined PAM and Doxo treatment resulted in stronger lethality in cancer cells than did PAM or Doxo treatment alone. To sum up, PAM has potential as an adjuvant in combination with other drugs to improve curative cancer therapies. ? 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.",cancer cell; chemotherapeutic drug; H2O2; helium-based low-temperature atmospheric-pressure plasma; molecule uptake; plasma-activated medium,Atmospheric pressure; Chemotherapy; Cytology; Diseases; Drug interactions; Fighter aircraft; Helium; Molecules; Oncology; Plasma jets; Temperature; Atmospheric pressure plasma jets; Cancer cells; Chemotherapeutic drugs; Combination chemotherapy; H2O2; Heptocellular carcinoma; Low temperatures; Metastatic cancers; Cells,2-s2.0-85044141059

This study aimed to identify potential plasma microRNAs (miRNAs) for the early detection of oral cancer. Plasma from normal, OL, and OSCC patients were evaluated. Small RNA sequencing was used to screen the differently expressed miRNAs among the groups. Next, these miRNAs were validated with individual samples by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays in the training phase (n = 72) and validation phase (n = 178). The possible physiological roles of the identified miRNAs were further investigated using bioinformatics analysis. Three miRNAs (miR-222-3p, miR-150-5p, and miR-423-5p) were identified as differentially expressed among groups; miR-222-3p and miR-423-5p negatively correlated with T stage, lymph node metastasis status, and clinical stage. A high diagnostic accuracy (Area under curve = 0.88) was demonstrated for discriminating OL from OSCC. Bioinformatics analysis reveals that miR-423-5p and miR-222-3p are significantly over-expressed in oral cancer tissues and involved in various cancer pathways. The three-plasma miRNA panel may be useful to monitor malignant progression from OL to OSCC and as potential biomarkers for early detection of oral cancer. ? 2018 by the authors.

Area covered: A thorough systematic literature review describing the current evidence and future prospects of therapeutic options for infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Expert commentary: The methods of detecting ESBLs have been evolving. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing lowered the MIC breakpoints of cephalosporins against ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in 2010. Phenotypic testing for ESBLs is no longer recommended. Instead, the selection of appropriate antimicrobial agents largely depends on the report of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). To date, therapeutic options for these multidrug-resistant organisms remain limited. The clinical efficacy of piperacillin/tazobactam and cefepime on in vitro-susceptible ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae remains a concern. Many studies found an in vitro-in vivo discordance based on current breakpoints. Carbapenems are the most reliable antibiotics for severe infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. However, their overuse has led to a serious problem of increasing drug resistance. Recently, ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam have been approved for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections. The introduction of these new β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations offers new carbapenem-sparing options for the treatment of ESBL infections. ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Antibiotic resistance; extended-spectrum β–lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae; treatment outcomes; β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations; β-lactamase,"amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; avibactam plus ceftazidime; aztreonam; beta lactamase inhibitor; carbapenem; carbapenem derivative; cefepime; cefmetazole; cefoperazone plus sulbactam; ceftazidime; ceftolozane plus tazobactam; ceftriaxone; cephalosporin derivative; cephamycin; cloxacillin; doripenem; flomoxef; fosfomycin; levofloxacin; meropenem; metronidazole; penicillin derivative; piperacillin plus tazobactam; antiinfective agent; beta lactamase; beta lactamase inhibitor; abdominal infection; acute pyelonephritis; antibiotic sensitivity; antibiotic therapy; bacteremia; bacterial clearance; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bactericidal activity; bacterium isolation; blaSHV 1 gene; blaTEM 1 gene; concentration response; disease severity; drug approval; drug efficacy; drug treatment failure; Enterobacteriaceae infection; Escherichia coli; extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae; Gram negative infection; hospital infection; human; in vitro study; infection; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Klebsiella pneumoniae infection; minimum inhibitory concentration; multidrug resistance; nonhuman; phenotype; pneumonia; point mutation; prevalence; Review; septic shock; survival rate; urinary tract infection; animal; beta-lactam resistance; drug effect; Enterobacteriaceae; Enterobacteriaceae infection; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; beta-Lactam Resistance; beta-Lactamase Inhibitors; beta-Lactamases; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Enterobacteriaceae; Enterobacteriaceae Infections; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests",2-s2.0-85042927592

Utilizing vehicle-based sensors, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, IMA offers extended vision to provide early warning for an imminent crash. However, most of IMA-related research implements their methods and strategies only in simulations, test tracks, or driving simulator studies that have quite a few assumptions and limitations and hence the effectiveness evaluations reported may not be transferable or comparable. Methods: This study seeks to develop a generalized evaluation scheme that can be used not only to assess the effectiveness of IMA on improving traffic safety at intersections but to facilitate comparisons across similar studies. The proposed evaluation scheme utilizes the concepts of traffic conflict in terms of time-to-collision (TTC) as a crash surrogate. This approach avoids the issue of having insufficient crash frequency data for system evaluation. To measure the effectiveness of IMA on reducing traffic conflicts, a relative risk is calculated for comparing the risk of with/without using the IMA. As a proof-of-concept study, this study applied the proposed evaluation scheme and reported the effectiveness of IMA on improving traffic safety in a field operation test (FOT). Seven test scenarios were conducted at 4 intersections, and a total of 40 participants were recruited to use the IMA for 6?months. Results: It was estimated that IMA users have 26% fewer conflicts with TTC less than 5?s and have 15% fewer conflicts with TTC less than 4?s. However, the results vary across different sites and different definitions of conflicts in terms of TTC. Conclusions: Overall, IMA is promising to effectively reduce angle crashes related to sight obstruction and has potential to reduce not only crash frequency but crash severity. ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Intersection movement assist; relative risk; time-to-collision; traffic conflict; traffic safety,"adult; aged; environmental planning; evaluation study; female; human; male; middle aged; prevention and control; protective equipment; statistics and numerical data; traffic accident; United States; Accidents, Traffic; Adult; Aged; Environment Design; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Protective Devices; United States",2-s2.0-85031939179

The shape, structure, and optical properties of the Cu@Cu2O@polymer NPs were tailorable by controlling the reaction parameters, for example, using the initial Cu@PSMA polymer NP as a template and varying the halide ion content, heating temperature, and reaction time. The Cu@Cu2O@polymer NPs exhibited robust NIR absorption between 650 and 710 nm and possessed superior oxidation resistance in water and culture media. In vitro assays demonstrated the low cytotoxicity of the Cu@Cu2O@PSMA polymer NPs to HeLa cells through an improved cell viability, high IC50, low injury incidence from the supernatant of the partly dissociated Cu@Cu2O@PSMA polymer NPs, and minor generation of reactive oxygen species. More importantly, we demonstrated that the inorganic Cu-based nanocomposite [+0.34 V vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)] was degradable in an endogenous H2O2 (+1.78 V vs NHE) environment. Cu ions were detected in the urine of mice, which illustrates the possibility of extraction after the degradation of the Cu-based particles. 'After an treatment of the HeLa cells with the Cu@Cu2O@polymer NPs and a 660 nm light-emitting diode, the photoablation of 50 and 90% cells was observed at NP doses of 20 and 50 ppm, respectively. These results demonstrate that NIR-functional and moderate redox-active Cu@Cu2O@polymer NPs are potential next-generation photothermal therapy (PTT) nanoagents because of combined features of degradation resistance in the physiological environment, enabling the delivery of efficient PTT, a possibly improved ability to selectively harm cancer cells by releasing Cu ions under high-H2O2 and/or low-pH conditions, and ability to be extracted from the body after biodegradation. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.",biodegradable; core-shell structure; Cu nanoparticle; extraction; near-infrared absorption; photothermal ablation; photothermal-chemotherapy,Biodegradation; Chemotherapy; Copper compounds; Copper oxides; Extraction; Heavy ions; Infrared devices; Ions; Lanthanum compounds; Light absorption; Nanoparticles; Optical properties; Polymers; Redox reactions; Synthesis (chemical); Water absorption; biodegradable; Core shell structure; Cu nano-particles; Near-infrared absorption; Photo-thermal; Photothermal ablation; Biodegradable polymers,2-s2.0-85042022067

For a health-checkup robot in a hospital, an IC card reader mounted on the robot is used to retrieve user's personal information from the cloud server. After data retrieval, a visiting list in the hospital is automatically scheduled for each patient. Next, the robot guides each user according to the scheduled list. The scheduling is completed by adopting the non preemptive Priority Scheduling approach. To assure safe human guidance and navigation, the robot uses data from two laser scanners: one is used for robot localization, and the other is used to detect user's leg for guidance. The robot uses Cartographer for localization and mapping. The guidance controller constantly adjusts motion commands depending on the user's position, meanwhile guides the user to the planned destination. The motion commands are executed by robot motion controller. The proposed design has been successfully verified using a prototype mobile robot in the lab environment. ? 2017 IEEE.",Hospital robot; Human Guidance; Robot control; Task scheduling,Automation; Controllers; Hospitals; Machine design; Motion planning; Multitasking; Process control; Robot applications; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Health check-ups; Human guidance; Localization and mappings; Personal information; Robot controls; Robot localization; Scheduling and controls; Task-scheduling; Robots,2-s2.0-85050470542

Previous literature concerning social identities generally suggests that people tend to show in-group favoritism toward members who share the same identity. However, how our brains process signals of identity while facing uncertain situations in interpersonal interactions remains largely unclear. To address this issue, we performed an fMRI experiment with 54 healthy adults who belonged to two identity groups of opposing political orientations. The identity information of participants was extracted from a large-scale social survey on the 2012 Taiwan presidential election. Accordingly, participants were categorized as either the Kuomintang (KMT) or the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) supporters. During the experiment, participants played trust games with computer agents with labels of the same or the opposing political identity. Interestingly, our results suggest that the behaviors of the two groups cannot be equally attributed to in-group favoritism. Behaviorally, only the DPP supporter group showed a significant trust preference toward in-group members, which did not hold for the KMT supporter group. Consistently, neurophysiological findings further revealed that only the DPP supporter group showed neuronal responses to both unexpected negative feedback from in-group members in anterior insula, temporoparietal junction, and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, as well as to unexpected rewards from out-group members in caudate. These findings therefore suggest that acquired identities play a more complex role in modulating people’s social expectation in interpersonal trust behaviors under identity-relevant contexts. ? 2018 Wu, Fan, Du, Yang, Liu, Yen, Chen and Hsung.",Decision making; Neuroeconomics; Political orientations; Social identity; Trust,adult; anterior insula; article; decision making; dorsal region; election; expectation; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; intergroup bias; lateral prefrontal cortex; major clinical study; male; negative feedback; nerve potential; reward; social status; Taiwan; temporoparietal junction; trust,2-s2.0-85043601536

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype is a breast cancer subset without ER (estrogen receptor), PR (progesterone receptor) and HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) expression, limiting treatment options and presenting a poorer survival rate. Thus, we investigated whether histone deacetylation inhibitor (HDACi) could be used as potential anti-cancer therapy on breast cancer cells. In this study, we found TNBC and HER2-enriched breast cancers are extremely sensitive to Panobinostat, Belinostat of HDACi via experiments of cell viability assay, apoptotic marker identification and flow cytometry measurement. On the other hand, we developed a bioluminescence-based live cell non-invasive apoptosis detection sensor (NIADS) detection system to evaluate the quantitative and kinetic analyses of apoptotic cell death by HDAC treatment on breast cancer cells. In addition, the use of HDACi may also contribute a synergic anti-cancer effect with co-treatment of chemotherapeutic agent such as doxorubicin on TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231), but not in breast normal epithelia cells (MCF-10A), providing therapeutic benefits against breast tumor in the clinic. ? 2018 by the authors.

However, narrow-band imaging expertise is required to differentiate hyperplastic from neoplastic polyps with high levels of accuracy. We developed and tested a system of computer-aided diagnosis with a deep neural network (DNN-CAD) to analyze narrow-band images of diminutive colorectal polyps. Methods: We collected 1476 images of neoplastic polyps and 681 images of hyperplastic polyps, obtained from the picture archiving and communications system database in a tertiary hospital in Taiwan. Histologic findings from the polyps were also collected and used as the reference standard. The images and data were used to train the DNN. A test set of images (96 hyperplastic and 188 neoplastic polyps, smaller than 5 mm), obtained from patients who underwent colonoscopies from March 2017 through August 2017, was then used to test the diagnostic ability of the DNN-CAD vs endoscopists (2 expert and 4 novice), who were asked to classify the images of the test set as neoplastic or hyperplastic. Their classifications were compared with findings from histologic analysis. The primary outcome measures were diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic time. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic time were compared among DNN-CAD, the novice endoscopists, and the expert endoscopists. The study was designed to detect a difference of 10% in accuracy by a 2-sided McNemar test. Results: In the test set, the DNN-CAD identified neoplastic or hyperplastic polyps with 96.3% sensitivity, 78.1% specificity, a PPV of 89.6%, and a NPV of 91.5%. Fewer than half of the novice endoscopists classified polyps with a NPV of 90% (their NPVs ranged from 73.9% to 84.0%). DNN-CAD classified polyps as neoplastic or hyperplastic in 0.45 ± 0.07 seconds—shorter than the time required by experts (1.54 ± 1.30 seconds) and nonexperts (1.77 ± 1.37 seconds) (both P < .001). DNN-CAD classified polyps with perfect intra-observer agreement (kappa score of 1). There was a low level of intra-observer and inter-observer agreement in classification among endoscopists. Conclusions: We developed a system called DNN-CAD to identify neoplastic or hyperplastic colorectal polyps less than 5 mm. The system classified polyps with a PPV of 89.6%, and a NPV of 91.5%, and in a shorter time than endoscopists. This deep-learning model has potential for not only endoscopic image recognition but for other forms of medical image analysis, including sonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance images. ? 2018 AGA Institute",Colon Cancer Detection; Cost-effectiveness; Machine Learning; Magnifying,"adenomatous polyp; adult; Article; cancer mortality; colonoscopy; colorectal polyp; comparative study; computer assisted radiography; computer assisted tomography; deep neural network; descending colon; descending colon polyp; diagnostic accuracy; endoscopist; female; human; image analysis; image enhancement; intestine polyp; major clinical study; male; McNemar test; narrow band imaging; nerve cell network; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; prediction; predictive value; priority journal; prospective study; rectum polyp; sigmoid; sigmoid colon polyp; Taiwan; tertiary care center; transverse colon; transverse colon polyp; artificial neural network; automation; classification; colon polyp; colonoscopy; colorectal tumor; computer assisted diagnosis; decision support system; factual database; hyperplasia; narrow band imaging; observer variation; pathology; procedures; reproducibility; retrospective study; tumor volume; Automation; Colonic Polyps; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Databases, Factual; Decision Support Techniques; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Humans; Hyperplasia; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Narrow Band Imaging; Neural Networks (Computer); Observer Variation; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan; Tumor Burden",2-s2.0-85044847443

In this study, we focused on the prevalence and related fungi of tinea capitis and asymptomatic carriage in elderly by the shampoo brush method, as well as the source of transmission, in 10 nursing home residents. Two hundred and thirteen residents were screened, and 186 isolates were identified, of which only three were dermatophytes (1.4%). The scalp dermatophyte isolates were identified as Trichophyton rubrum by morphological characters and sequences comparisons in all three cases. After revisiting, these cases were proved to be asymptomatic carriers by negative microscopic and culture examination; however, two cases were found to have concurrent tinea pedis and onychomycosis, which were identified as T. rubrum and Trichophyton interdigitale. The source of the T. rubrum scalp carriage may come from tinea elsewhere on the body of the same subject or from other people in the same institute.

This nationwide matched-cohort population-based study aimed to investigate the association between fibromyalgia and the risk of developing dementia, and to clarify the association between fibromyalgia and dementia. Materials and Methods: A total of 41,612 patients of age ?50 years with newly diagnosed fibromyalgia between January 1, and December 31, 2000 were selected from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, along with 124,836 controls matched for sex and age. After adjusting for any confounding factors, Fine and Gray competing risk analysis was used to compare the risk of developing dementia during the 10 years of follow-up. Results: Of the study subjects, 1,704 from 41,612 fibromyalgia patients (21.23 per 1,000 person-years) developed dementia when compared to 4,419 from 124,836 controls (18.94 per 1,000 person-years).

After adjusting for sex, age, monthly income, urbanization level, geographic region of residence and comorbidities the hazard ratio was 2.77 (95% CI: 2.61-2.95, P < 0.001). Fibromyalgia was associated with increased risk of all types of dementia in this study. Conclusions: The study subjects with fibromyalgia had a 2.77-fold risk of dementia in comparison to the control group.

Moreover, discontinuous eradications from the high prevalence state to the low prevalence or disease free state are also separately seen as the transmission rate reaches a threshold α e (&lt; α o) from the above when the outbreak occurs.

These findings provide clear evidence that resistin is a clinically relevant endogenous ligand for TLR4, which promotes tumor progression via TLR4/NF-κB/STAT3 signaling, providing insights into a novel therapeutic target in breast cancer. ?2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

As carbohydrate-binding proteins, they participate in intracellular trafficking, cell adhesion, and cell–cell signaling. Accumulating evidence indicates that they play a pivotal role in numerous physiological and pathological activities, such as the regulation on cancer progression, inflammation, immune response, and bacterial and viral infections. Galectins have drawn much attention as targets for therapeutic interventions. Several molecules have been developed as galectin inhibitors. In particular, TD139, a thiodigalactoside derivative, is currently examined in clinical trials for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Herein, we provide an in-depth review on the development of galectin inhibitors, aiming at the dissection of the structure–activity relationship to demonstrate how inhibitors interact with galectin(s). We especially integrate the structural information established by X-ray crystallography with several biophysical methods to offer, not only in-depth understanding at the molecular level, but also insights to tackle the existing challenges. ? 2018 by the authors.

The 5-year survival rate for women with EOC is only 30%-50%, which is largely due to the typically late diagnosis of this condition. EOC is difficult to detect in its early stage because of its asymptomatic nature. Recently, near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) imaging has been developed as a potential tool for detecting EOC at the molecular level. In this study, a NIRF-sensitive probe was designed to detect matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in ovarian cancer cells. A cyanine fluorochrome was conjugated to the amino terminus of a peptide substrate with enzymatic specificity for MMP-3. To analyze the novel MMP-3 probe, an in vivo EOC model was established by subcutaneously implanting SKOV3 cells, a serous-type EOC cell line, in mice. This novel MMP-3-sensitive probe specifically reacted with only the active MMP-3 enzyme, resulting in a significantly enhanced NIRF emission intensity. Histological analysis demonstrated that MMP-3 expression and activity were enhanced in the stromal cells surrounding the ovarian cancer cells. These studies establish a molecular imaging reporter for diagnosing early-stage EOC. Additional studies are required to confirm the early-stage activity of MMP-3 in EOC and its diagnostic and prognostic significance. ? 2018 Wang et al.

Materials and methods Here, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to study the composition of oral microorganisms in OSCC patients, whose cancer mutational profiles were previously defined by whole-exome sequencing, to evaluate the relationship between oral microbiome and the mutational changes in OSCC. Results Analyzing the contributions of the five mutational signatures extracted from the primary tumors revealed three groups of OSCC (mutational signature cluster, MSC1-3) that were significantly associated with demographic and clinical features. Taxonomic analysis of the predominant phyla in salivary samples showed variation in the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the three MSC groups. In addition, significant differences in bacterial species richness (alpha diversity) and slight sample-to-sample dissimilarities in bacterial community structures (beta diversity) were noted among different MSC groups. Further, predicting the functional capabilities of microbial communities by reconstruction of unobserved states showed that many pathways related to cell motility were differentially enriched among the three MSC groups. Conclusion Collectively, these results indicate a potential association of oral microbiome with the mutational changes in OSCC. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",16S rRNA; Mutational signature; Oral microbiota; Oral squamous cell carcinoma,"alcohol; protein p53; RNA 16S; RNA 16S; Actinobacteria; Actinomycetales; alcohol consumption; amplicon; Article; Bacteroidetes; cancer patient; Capnocytophaga; cell motility; clinical article; clinical feature; cohort analysis; community structure; controlled study; Firmicutes; Fusobacteria; gene sequence; genomics; histopathology; human; lymph node metastasis; male; microbial community; microbial diversity; mouth cancer; mouth flora; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; Neisseria; Prevotella; primary tumor; priority journal; Proteobacteria; species richness; Streptococcus; taxonomy; tobacco use; tumor volume; Veillonella; whole exome sequencing; Wnt signaling; genetics; microbiology; microflora; mouth; mouth tumor; mutation; squamous cell carcinoma; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Humans; Microbiota; Mouth; Mouth Neoplasms; Mutation; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",2-s2.0-85037695081

Methods We conducted a nested case-control study using National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. A total of 14,288 patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia were included; 7651 in the cataract group and 6637 in the control group. Based on overall cumulative period of MS (lithium, carbamazepine, valproate, and lamotrigine) treatment, we categorized into following groups: no use, and duration < 1 year, 1 to 2 years, and > 2 years. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to explore the association between use of MS and risk of cataract development. Results The risks for cataract development were significantly higher in patients using lithium alone and lithium combined with other MS for more than 2 years (adjusted odd ratio [AOR] = 1.39; 95% CI = 1.01–1.92, p = 0.043 and AOR = 1.44; 95% CI = 1.13–1.85, p = 0.003, respectively) than in non-users. Furthermore, the risks of cataract development increased in those treated with valproic acid combined with other MS (AOR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.02–1.57, p = 0.035). Finally, no increased risks of cataract development were found in carbamazepine and lamotrigine users.

Herein, we have developed a fluorescence turn off-on fluorescence sensing platform by combining nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) with V 2 O 5 nanosheets for the sensitive and selective detection of cysteine in human serum samples. V 2 O 5 nanosheets with 2-4 layers are successfully synthesized via a simple and scalable liquid exfoliation method and then deposited with 2-8 nm of N-GQDs as the fluorescence turn off-on nanoprobe for effective detection of cysteine in human serum samples. The V 2 O 5 nanosheets serve as both fluorescence quencher and cysteine recognizer in the sensing platform. The fluorescence intensity of N-GQDs with quantum yield of 0.34 can be quenched after attachment onto V 2 O 5 nanosheets. The addition of cysteine triggers the reduction of V 2 O 5 to V 4+ as well as the release of N-GQDs within 4 min, resulting in the recovery of fluorescence intensity for the turn off-on detection of cysteine. The sensing platform exhibits a two-stage linear response to cysteine in the concentration range of 0.1-15 and 15-125 μM at pH 6.5, and the limit of detection is 50 nM. The fluorescence response of N-GQD@V 2 O 5 exhibits high selectivity toward cysteine over other 22 electrolytes and biomolecules. Moreover, this promising platform is successfully applied in detection of cysteine in human serum samples with excellent recovery of (95 ± 3.8) - (108 ± 2.4)%. These results clearly demonstrate a newly developed redox reaction-based nanosensing platform using N-GQD@V 2 O 5 nanocomposites as the sensing probe for cysteine-associated disease monitoring and diagnosis in biomedical applications, which can open an avenue for the development of high performance and robust sensing probes to detect organic metabolites. ? 2017 American Chemical Society.",cysteine detection; fluorescence; N-GQDs; redox reaction; turn off-on sensing; V 2 O 5 nanosheet,"Body fluids; Diagnosis; Doping (additives); Fluorescence; Graphene; Medical applications; Nanocrystals; Nanosheets; Probes; Redox reactions; Semiconductor quantum dots; Vanadium compounds; Biomedical applications; Concentration ranges; Fluorescence intensities; Fluorescence quenchers; Fluorescence sensing; Nitrogen doped graphene; Organic metabolites; Selective detection; Amino acids; cysteine; graphite; quantum dot; vanadium derivative; vanadium pentoxide; human; spectrofluorometry; Cysteine; Graphite; Humans; Quantum Dots; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Vanadium Compounds",2-s2.0-85039065893

This study aimed to investigate the association between the usage of MgO and the risk of developing dementia. Methods: We used a dataset from the National Health Research Institute Database (NHRID) of Taiwan containing one million randomly sampled subjects to identify patients aged ?50 years with no history of MgO usage. A total of 1547 patients who had used MgO were enrolled, along with 4641 controls who had not used the MgO propensity score matched by age, gender and comorbidity, at a ratio of 1:3. After adjusting for confounding risk factors, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the risk of developing dementia during a 10 year follow-up period. Results: Of the enrolled patients, 44 (2.84%) developed dementia, when compared to 199 (4.28%) in the control group. The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that the patients who had used MgO were less likely to develop dementia with a crude hazard ratio of 0.617 (95% CI, 0.445–0.856, p =.004). After adjusting for age, gender, comorbidity, geographical area and urbanization level of residence, and monthly income, the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.517 (95% CI, 0.412–0.793, p =.001). Conclusions: The patients who used MgO had a decreased risk of developing dementia.

The aim of this study is to explore essential biomarker and use CRISPR/Cas9 with lentivirus delivery to establish a gene-target therapeutic platform in ATC cells. At the beginning, the gene expression datasets from 1036 cancers from CCLE and 8215 tumors from TCGA were collected and analyzed, showing EGFR is predominantly overexpressed in thyroid cancers than other type of cancers (P = 0 017 in CCLE and P = 0 001 in TCGA). Using CRISPR/Cas9 genomic edit system, ATC cells with EGFR sgRNA lentivirus transfection obtained great disruptions on gene and protein expression, resulting in cell cycle arrest, cell growth inhibition, and most importantly metastasis turn-off ability. In addition, the FDA-approved TKI of afatinib for EGFR targeting also illustrates great anticancer activity on cancer cell death occurrence, cell growth inhibition, and cell cycle arrest in SW579 cells, an EGFR expressing human ATC cell line. Furthermore, off-target effect of using EGFR sgRNAs was measured and found no genomic editing can be detected in off-target candidate gene.

Empowering PHR provides health awareness and intention for health promotion. Objective: The purpose of this study was to present a research framework to examine individuals’ intention to PHR use. Methods: This cross-sectional study used the questionnaire to collect data from the individual in Taiwan. Individual’s intention to use PHR has been examined by a framework based on extended technology acceptance model (TAM), with gender and health-care technology self-efficacy (HTSE) as external variables. Additionally, gender differences were explored in perceptions and relationships among factors influencing an individual’s intention to PHR use. The research framework was evaluated by structural equation modeling (SEM) and represented by Analysis of a Moment Structures (AMOS). Results: A total of 234 valid responses were used for analysis. The results suggest that the extended TAM model explains 40.6% of the variance of intention to PHR use (R2?=?0.406). The findings also supported that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and attitude toward using PHR significantly influenced individual’s intention to PHR use. Additionally, results also indicated that women were more strongly influenced by perceptions of HTSE. Conclusions: The extended TAM model contributes reasonable explanation for interprets and anticipates of individuals’ intention to use and adopt PHR. Moreover, the results have provided support for HTSE and gender as significant variables in TAM. However, the study identified three relevant factors directly and one factor indirectly influencing on individuals’ intention to PHR use.

Humans perform various motions according to different task goals and physiological sensory perception; however, most existing computational approaches for motion simulation and generation rarely consider the effects of human perception. The assumption of perfect perception (i.e., no sensory errors) of existing approaches restricts the generated motion types and makes dynamical reactions less realistic. We propose a general framework for sensorimotor control, integrating a balance controller and a vestibular model, to generate perception-aware motions. By exploiting simulated perception, more natural responses that are closer to human reactions can be generated. For example, motion sickness caused by the impairments in the function of the vestibular system induces postural instability and body sway. Our approach generates physically correct motions and reasonable reactions to external stimuli since the spatial orientation estimation by the vestibular system is essential to preserve balance. We evaluate our framework by demonstrating standing balance on a rotational platform with different angular speeds and duration. The generated motions show that either faster angular speeds or longer rotational duration cause more severe motion sickness. Our results demonstrate that sensorimotor control, integrating human perception and physically-based control, offers considerable potential for providing more human-like behaviors, especially for perceptual illusions of human beings, including visual, proprioceptive, and tactile sensations. ? 2018 The Author(s) and 2018 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Computing methodologies → Animation; Physical simulation,Behavioral research; Diseases; Computational approach; Computing methodologies; Dynamical reactions; Motor skill learning; Physical simulation; Postural instabilities; Sensorimotor control; Spatial orientations; Sensory perception,2-s2.0-85051537199

Therefore, identifying targetable genetic mutations and mutational signatures associated with prognosis and treatment strategies are needed. Ultra-deep sequencing of 409 cancer genes using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from 33 male patients with hepatitis B virus-associated HCC was performed to identify mutational signatures associated with the prognosis of HCC. A total of 47 genes were found to be mutated in more than 10% of patients. Chromatin remodeling genes were overrepresented in the mutation profile. We found patient survival was associated with mutations in NOTCH1 and the nucleotide excision repair genes which have not been described previously in HCC. From the mutation profile, six patients were eligible for Sorafenib treatment. Among the remaining patients, 7 patients had mutations in genes that are targets for other cancer drugs and 16 patients had mutations in potentially targetable genes. Only one patient carried no potential drug target. We identified mutational signatures associated with the patient survival of HCC. The findings may facilitate identifying subgroups of patients with a poor prognosis as well as potential drug targets for use in personalized strategies for HCC treatment. ?

Currently, there is no effective therapeutic agent or vaccine against DENV infection; hence, there is an urgent need to discover anti-DENV agents. The potential therapeutic efficacy of lucidone was first evaluated in vivo using a DENV-infected Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) suckling mouse model by monitoring body weight, clinical score, survival rate, and viral titer. We found that lucidone effectively protected mice from DENV infection by sustaining survival rate and reducing viral titers in DENV-infected ICR suckling mice. Then, the anti-DENV activity of lucidone was confirmed by western blotting and quantitative-reverse-transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction analysis, with an EC50 value of 25 ± 3 μM. Lucidone significantly induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) production against DENV replication by inhibiting DENV NS2B/3 protease activity to induce the DENV-suppressed antiviral interferon response. The inhibitory effect of lucidone on DENV replication was attenuated by silencing of HO-1 gene expression or blocking HO-1 activity. In addition, lucidone-stimulated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which is involved in transactivation of HO-1 expression for its anti-DENV activity. Taken together, the mechanistic investigations revealed that lucidone exhibits significant anti-DENV activity in in vivo and in vitro by inducing Nrf2-mediated HO-1 expression, leading to blockage of viral protease activity to induce the anti-viral interferon (IFN) response. These results suggest that lucidone is a promising candidate for drug development. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Dengue virus; Heme oxygnase-1; Interferon response; Lucidone; Viral replication,"complementary DNA; heme oxygenase 1; lucidone; nitric oxide; plant medicinal product; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor Nrf2; unclassified drug; antivirus agent; cyclopentane derivative; heme oxygenase 1; lucidone; Nfe2l2 protein, mouse; transcription factor Nrf2; animal experiment; animal model; antioxidant activity; antiviral activity; apoptosis; Article; cell viability assay; controlled study; cytotoxicity assay; dengue; drug mechanism; EC50; gene expression; genetic transfection; homeostasis; human; human cell; immune response; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative stress; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; transient transfection; upregulation; virus replication; Western blotting; Zika fever; animal; biosynthesis; body weight; dengue; Dengue virus; disease model; drug effect; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; newborn; pathology; physiology; survival analysis; treatment outcome; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Antiviral Agents; Body Weight; Cyclopentanes; Dengue; Dengue Virus; Disease Models, Animal; Heme Oxygenase-1; Mice, Inbred ICR; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome; Virus Replication",2-s2.0-85046864178

A simulation software is an effective method that simulates a virtual environment to allow students to apply and comprehend the knowledge they have learned from lectures. Recently, Chang, Chen, Yang, and Chao (2009) developed a simulation of a production and logistics environment (referred to as SIMPLE hereafter) software as a teaching aid which has been adapted in different courses teaching productions and logistics. However, in SIMPLE, only a linear supply chain model can be constructed, which means that only one affiliate in each echelon. Therefore, SIMPLE cannot be applied when teaching material related to supply chain network design. In order to encourage students to explore the knowledge of supply chain design without actually managing a real supply chain, this study constructed simulation software to allow students design their own supply networks to meet customers' demand and to compare the performance resulted from different supply chain networks. The functions of this software include adjustable facility selection for different members of supply chains, each of which can be associated with different inventory replenishment policy and transportation arrangement. The network constructed is displayed graphically and can also be saved for reuse. This software can set varied scenarios for lecturing or can be used as a mean for students to compete with each other by applying their knowledge learned in lectures. After using this software in a graduate-level Supply Chain Management course in a national university in Taiwan, it is found that students were attracted to this game/toy-based learning and were willing to explore related material on their own. ?

Autophagy is an event occurring in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic LC3 puncta formation is a hallmark of autophagy. Graphene oxide (GO) is a nanomaterial that provokes autophagy in CT26 colon cancer cells and confers antitumor effects. Here we aimed to evaluate whether combined use of GO with CDDP (GO/CDDP) overcomes chemoresistance in different cancer cells and uncover the underlying mechanism. Methods: We treated different cancer cells with GO/CDDP and evaluated the cytotoxicity, death mechanism, autophagy induction and nuclear entry of CDDP. We further knocked down genes essential for autophagic flux and deciphered which step is critical to nuclear import and cell death. Finally, we performed immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry and immunofluorescence labeling to evaluate the association of LC3 and CDDP. Results: We uncovered that combination of GO and CDDP (GO/CDDP) promoted the killing of not only CT26 cells, but also ovarian, cervical and prostate cancer cells. In the highly chemosensitized Skov-3 cells, GO/CDDP significantly enhanced concurrent nuclear import of CDDP and autophagy marker LC3 and elevated cell necrosis, which required autophagy initiation and progression but did not necessitate late autophagy events (e.g., autophagosome completion and autolysosome formation). The GO/CDDP-elicited nuclear trafficking and cell death also required importin α/β, and LC3 also co-migrated with CDDP and histone H1/H4 into the nucleus. In particular, GO/CDDP triggered histone H4 acetylation in the nucleus, which could decondense the chromosome and enable CDDP to more effectively access chromosomal DNA to trigger cell death. Conclusion: These findings shed light on the mechanisms of GO/CDDP-induced chemosensitization and implicate the potential applications of GO/CDDP to treat multiple cancers. ?

However, identification of molecular targets as biomarker for elevating therapeutic efficacy is critical to prolong HCC patient survival. Here, we showed that EIF3C (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit C) is upregulated during HCC tumor progression and associated with poor patient survival. Expression of EIF3C did not alter proliferation and expression of other tumor progressive genes such as HIF1A, TGFβ1 and VEGF, but reduced cell migration in HCC cells. Nevertheless, expression of EIF3C in HCC cells significantly increase secretion of extracellular exosomes confirmed by increased exosomes labelling by PKH26 fluorescent dye, vesicles in exosome size detected by electronic microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis, and expression of divergent exosome markers. The EIF3C-increased exosomes were oncogenic to potentiate tumor angiogenesis via tube formation of HUVEC cells and growth of vessels by plugs assays on nude mice. Subcutaneous inoculation of EIF3C-exosomes mixed with Huh7 HCC cells not only promoted growth of vessels but also increased expression of EIF3C in tumors. Conversely, treatment of exosome inhibitor GW4869 reversed aforementioned oncogenic assays. We identified EIF3C activated expression of S100A11 involved in EIF3C-exosome increased tube formation in angiogenesis. Simultaneous high expression of EIF3C and S100A11 in human HCC tumors for RNA level in TCGA and protein level by IHC are associated with poor survival of HCC patients.

Deregulation of ribose-5-phosphate isomerase A (RPIA) in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is known to promote tumorigenesis in liver, lung, and breast tissues. Yet, the molecular mechanism of RPIA-mediated colorectal cancer (CRC) is unknown. Our study demonstrates a noncanonical function of RPIA in CRC. Data from the mRNAs of 80 patients’ CRC tissues and paired nontumor tissues and protein levels, as well as a CRC tissue array, indicate RPIA is significantly elevated in CRC. RPIA modulates cell proliferation and oncogenicity via activation of β-catenin in colon cancer cell lines. Unlike its role in PPP in which RPIA functions within the cytosol, RPIA enters the nucleus to form a complex with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and β-catenin. This association protects β-catenin by preventing its phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation. The C-terminus of RPIA (amino acids 290 to 311), a region distinct from its enzymatic domain, is necessary for RPIA-mediated tumorigenesis. Consistent with results in vitro, RPIA increases the expression of β-catenin and its target genes, and induces tumorigenesis in gut-specific promotor-carrying RPIA transgenic zebrafish. Together, we demonstrate a novel function of RPIA in CRC formation in which RPIA enters the nucleus and stabilizes β-catenin activity and suggests that RPIA might be a biomarker for targeted therapy and prognosis. ? 2018 Chou et al.",,"beta catenin; messenger RNA; ribose 5 phosphate isomerase A; tumor protein; unclassified drug; beta catenin; isomerase; messenger RNA; ribosephosphate isomerase; adult; animal experiment; Article; cancer growth; cancer staging; carboxy terminal sequence; carcinogenesis; carcinogenicity; cell nucleus; cell proliferation; colon cancer cell line; colon polyposis; colorectal cancer; controlled study; cytosol; down regulation; enzyme structure; gene targeting; human; human tissue; in vitro study; major clinical study; nonhuman; pentose phosphate cycle; protein analysis; protein degradation; protein expression; protein function; protein phosphorylation; tumor promotion; upregulation; aged; animal; cell transformation; colorectal tumor; female; genetics; male; metabolism; middle aged; phosphorylation; physiology; promoter region; protein domain; transgenic animal; tumor cell line; ubiquitination; zebra fish; Adenomatous Polyposis Coli; Adult; Aged; Aldose-Ketose Isomerases; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; beta Catenin; Carcinogenesis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Nucleus; Cell Proliferation; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Phosphorylation; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Domains; RNA, Messenger; Ubiquitination; Zebrafish",2-s2.0-85041710224

MicroRNAs are single-stranded RNA molecules of 21–23 nucleotides that regulate target gene expression through specific base-pairing interactions between miRNA and untranslated regions of targeted mRNAs. In this study, we generated a multistep approach for the integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression. First, both miRNA and mRNA expression profiling datasets in gastric cancer from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) identified 79 and 1042 differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs, respectively, in gastric cancer. Second, inverse correlations between miRNA and mRNA expression levels identified 3206 miRNA–mRNA pairs combined with 79 dysregulated miRNAs and their 774 target mRNAs predicted by three prediction tools, miRanda, PITA, and RNAhybrid. Additionally, miR-204, which was found to be down-regulated in gastric cancer, was ectopically over-expressed in the AGS gastric cancer cell line and all down-regulated targets were identified by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Over-expression of miR-204 reduced the gastric cancer cell proliferation and suppressed the expression of three targets which were validated by qRT-PCR and luciferase assays. For the first time, we identified that CKS1B, CXCL1, and GPRC5A are putative targets of miR-204 and elucidated that miR-204 acted as potential tumor suppressor and, therefore, are useful as a promising therapeutic target for gastric cancer. ? 2017 by the authors.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between anxiety disorders (ADs) and tinnitus in a large population. Method We conducted a cross-sectional study using the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Study subjects included 14,772 patients with tinnitus and 709,963 people in the general population who sought treatment in 2005. Distributions in ADs, age, sex, and medical comorbidities were compared between groups using chi-squared tests. Multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and medical comorbidities were used to analyze the association between tinnitus and ADs. Results Prevalence of ADs in tinnitus and general population groups was 3.9% and 1.5%, respectively, and this difference was significant (P < 0.001). Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, concussion or head injury, Meniere's disease, sensorineural hearing impairment, renal disease, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease were significantly more prevalent in the tinnitus group (all P-values < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression model demonstrated that patients with tinnitus were significantly associated with increased risk of ADs (adjusted OR = 1.99; 95% CI = 1.81–2.19; P < 0.001). Conclusion Because the risk of ADs was significantly higher in patients with tinnitus than in the general population, physicians should be aware of the importance of psychological factors in tinnitus management. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Anxiety disorder; National Health Insurance Research Database; NHIRD; Prevalence; Tinnitus,adult; anxiety disorder; Article; cerebrovascular disease; comorbidity; concussion; coronary artery disease; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; female; head injury; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; kidney disease; major clinical study; male; Meniere disease; middle aged; perception deafness; population research; prevalence; risk assessment; Taiwan; tinnitus; aged; anxiety disorder; cohort analysis; public health; risk; statistics and numerical data; tinnitus; young adult; Adult; Aged; Anxiety Disorders; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; National Health Programs; Prevalence; Risk; Taiwan; Tinnitus; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85034947951

Methods and Materials Cancer patients with bony metastases and pain score ?4 on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) were randomized to RT of 30 Gy in 10 fractions combined with HT (RT + HT) versus RT alone. Hyperthermia was performed by the Thermotron RF-8, with maintenance of the target temperature for 40 minutes per treatment within 2 hours after RT, twice weekly for 2 weeks. Patients were stratified by lesion number (solitary or multiple), BPI score (4-6 vs 7-10), and primary site. The primary endpoint was complete response (CR) (BPI = 0 with no increase of analgesics) within 3 months after treatment. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. Results The study was terminated early after an interim analysis of 57 patients, 3 years after the first enrollment (November 2013 to November 2016): 29 patients in the RT + HT group and 28 patients in the RT-alone group. The CR rate at 3 months after treatment was 37.9% in the RT + HT group versus 7.1% in the RT-alone group (P=.006). The accumulated CR rate within 3 months after treatment was 58.6% in the RT + HT group versus 32.1% in the RT-alone group (P=.045). Median time to pain progression was 55 days in patients with CR (n=9) in the RT-alone group, whereas the endpoint was not reached during the 24-week follow-up in the RT + HT group (P<.01). Conclusions The addition of HT to RT significantly increases the pain control rate and extends response duration compared with RT alone for painful bony metastases. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",,"Health; Hyperthermia therapy; Pathology; Radiotherapy; After-treatment; Cancer patients; Complete response; Controlled trial; External beam radiation; Interim analysis; Methods and materials; Target temperature; Patient treatment; adult; analgesia; Article; body temperature disorder; bone metastasis; Brief Pain Inventory; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; core temperature; disease duration; external beam radiotherapy; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nausea and vomiting; painful bony metastasis; patient safety; phase 3 clinical trial; priority journal; prospective study; radiation dermatitis; radiation dose; radiation injury; randomized controlled trial; response evaluation criteria in solid tumors; skin manifestation; therapy effect; thermotherapy; treatment duration; tumor volume; aged; bone tumor; breast tumor; clinical trial; comparative study; devices; diagnostic imaging; early termination of clinical trial; multimodality cancer therapy; musculoskeletal pain; procedures; prostate tumor; radiation dose fractionation; recurrent disease; secondary; thermotherapy; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Aged; Bone Neoplasms; Breast Neoplasms; Combined Modality Therapy; Dose Fractionation; Early Termination of Clinical Trials; Female; Humans; Hyperthermia, Induced; Male; Middle Aged; Musculoskeletal Pain; Pain Management; Prospective Studies; Prostatic Neoplasms; Recurrence; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-85031812874

Under motion, the respiratory sounds are easily affected by the vibration of the human body. Moreover, it is also inconvenient to wear the conventional electronic stethoscope system. In order to improve the above issues, a novel wireless respiratory sound recording system was proposed to collect respiratory sound under motion. Here, a wireless and wearable respiratory sound recording device was designed to collect respiratory sound wirelessly. It is also easy to wear and monitor respiratory sound under motion due to its advantages of small volume and wireless transmission. Moreover, the technique of adaptive filter was also applied to enhance the noisy respiratory sound from single channel trial. From the experimental results, the noisy respiratory sound can be effectively improved by the proposed adaptive filter. Therefore, the proposed system exactly contains the potential of being a good assisting tool for lung diseases and may be applied in the applications of lung and sports medicine in the future. ?

As the rising of consumers’ purchase motive is one of the main design objectives, affective attraction is the key core of product design. To realize the objective, designers have adopted many methods in the design process. Among these methods, it is the most common one to stimulate ideas with picture boards which can be used to directly express and distinguish product pictures and also as a tool of affective evaluation. The research targets to the life style boards proposed by Baxter, as they are widely used. The research aims to build a database which can provide proper pictures to express different life style ethnics’ life images, waste a huge amount of time and reduce the burden of artificially collecting pictures. In the research, 100 consumers are firstly invited for screening the life style ethnics and 23 representatives selected. Then, 6 experts and scholars from different fields are invited to select the adjective words and pictures for the life style ethnics, and then the SD evaluation investigation is made among the 23 representatives to obtain the adjective words and pictures of the LOHAS’ life styles. The research result will significantly influence the design process, improve the product design efficiency, increase the expression accuracy of design pictures and allow more people to participate in the design process of image boards.

Management of intraoperative hemorrhage is therefore a critical issue of this study. This study presents experience in the treatment of patients with various types of ICH by MIE evacuation followed by direct local injection of FloSeal Hemostatic Matrix (Baxter Healthcare Corp, Fremont, CA, USA) for hemostasis. Methods: The retrospective nonrandomized clinical and radiology-based analysis enrolled 42 patients treated with MIE evacuation of ICH followed by direct local injection of FloSeal Hemostatic Matrix. Rebleeding, morbidity, and mortality were the primary endpoints. The percentage of hematoma evacuated was calculated from the pre- and postoperative brain computed tomography (CT) scans. Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) was evaluated at 6 months postoperatively. Results: Forty-two ICH patients were included in this study, among these, 23 patients were putaminal hemorrhage, 16 were thalamic ICH, and the other three were subcortical type. Surgery-related mortality was 2.4%. The average percentage of hematoma evacuated was 80.8%, and the rebleeding rate was 4.8%. The mean operative time was 102.7 minutes and the average blood loss was 84.9 mL. The mean postoperative GOSE score was 4.55 at 6-months' follow-up. Conclusion: This study shows that local application of FloSeal Hemostatic Matrix is safe and effective for hemostasis during MIE evacuation of ICH. In our experience, this shortens the operation time, especially in cases with intraoperative bleeding. A large, prospective, randomized trial is needed to confirm the findings. ? 2017",Endoscope-assisted surgery; FloSeal Hemostatic Matrix; Local hemostatic agent; Minimally invasive surgery; Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage,"hemostatic agent; sealant; FloSeal Matrix; gelatin sponge; hemostatic agent; adult; aged; Article; basal ganglion hemorrhage; brain hematoma; brain hemorrhage; brain stem; clinical article; controlled study; endoscopic surgery; female; follow up; Glasgow outcome scale; hemiparesis; hemiplegia; hemostatic technique; human; male; middle aged; minimally invasive surgery; morbidity; mortality rate; operation duration; operative blood loss; personal experience; pneumonia; postoperative infection; postoperative period; putaminal hemorrhage; retrospective study; sepsis; surgical mortality; thalamus disease; urinary tract infection; brain hemorrhage; clinical trial; complication; epidemiology; Glasgow coma scale; hematoma; mortality; multicenter study; neuroendoscopy; procedures; Taiwan; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Blood Loss, Surgical; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Female; Gelatin Sponge, Absorbable; Glasgow Coma Scale; Hematoma; Hemostatics; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuroendoscopy; Operative Time; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85016074614

Most of the virtual screening methods in flaviviral drug discovery suffer from a low hit rate, strain-specific efficacy differences, and susceptibility to resistance. It is because they often fail to capture the key pharmacological features of the target active site critical for protein function inhibition. So in our current work, for the flaviviral NS3 protease, we summarized the pharmacophore features at the protease active site as anchors (subsite-moiety interactions). Results: For each of the four flaviviral NS3 proteases (i.e., HCV, DENV, WNV, and JEV), the anchors were obtained and summarized into 'Pharmacophore anchor (PA) models'. To capture the conserved pharmacophore anchors across these proteases, were merged the four PA models. We identified five consensus core anchors (CEH1, CH3, CH7, CV1, CV3) in all PA models, represented as the ""Core pharmacophore anchor (CPA) model"" and also identified specific anchors unique to the PA models. Our PA/CPA models complied with 89 known NS3 protease inhibitors. Furthermore, we proposed an integrated anchor-based screening method using the anchors from our models for discovering inhibitors. This method was applied on the DENV NS3 protease to screen FDA drugs discovering boceprevir, telaprevir and asunaprevir as promising anti-DENV candidates. Experimental testing against DV2-NGC virus by in-vitro plaque assays showed that asunaprevir and telaprevir inhibited viral replication with EC50 values of 10.4 μM &amp; 24.5 μM respectively. The structure-anchor-activity relationships (SAAR) showed that our PA/CPA model anchors explained the observed in-vitro activities of the candidates. Also, we observed that the CEH1 anchor engagement was critical for the activities of telaprevir and asunaprevir while the extent of inhibitor anchor occupation guided their efficacies. Conclusion: These results validate our NS3 protease PA/CPA models, anchors and the integrated anchor-based screening method to be useful in inhibitor discovery and lead optimization, thus accelerating flaviviral drug discovery. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Core and specific anchors; DENV NS3 protease; Flaviviral NS3 proteases; Integrated anchor-based virtual screening; Pharmacophore anchor models,Diagnosis; Drug products; Enzyme activity; Enzyme inhibition; Pharmacodynamics; Strain rate; Viruses; Anchor models; DENV NS3 protease; Experimental testing; Flaviviral NS3 proteases; NS3 protease inhibitors; Screening methods; Viral replication; Virtual Screening; Anchors; peptide hydrolase; chemistry; Dengue virus; drug repositioning; Flavivirus; genetics; human; immunology; procedures; Dengue Virus; Drug Repositioning; Flavivirus; Humans; Peptide Hydrolases,2-s2.0-85039750598

It is important during the rehabilitation that a user obtains assistance from the exoskeleton in an adaptive manner, as the user may improve his/her walking during rehabilitation. The assistance from the machine will be less or more according to the current situation of the user during the use of the exoskeleton. The question then arises as to how the exoskeleton can provide adaptive adjustment. It was decided that a tangible design was to measure the user status such as the user interaction force during walking. In this design, force sensors are installed on each link of exoskeleton to record the user walking effort during walking. By measuring this force, the control computer of the exoskeleton will understand for each cycle what the status of the user is and predict an adaptive torque according to measured force. In order to generate a suitable torque, the compliant motion control, which is a combination of impedance and admittance control is used. Walking experiments of a healthy person to wear the AEXO have been carried out in the lab. The first experiment verified the propose algorithm by using a predefined reference trajectory for the user and giving an adjustment to the reference trajectory based on the interaction torque. The second experiment verified that even without the predefined gait trajectory to the user, the exoskeleton can move in compliance to the user under various walking speeds. For the future development, the method will be expanded and tested for people who suffer from stroke or other walking impairment. ? 2017 Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems - ICROS.",Compliant Motion Control; Exoskeleton Control; Human Machine Interaction,Motion control; Navigation; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Torque; Trajectories; Walking aids; Adaptive adjustment; Admittance control; Compliant motion control; Current situation; Human machine interaction; Reference trajectories; Rehabilitation devices; Tangible designs; Exoskeleton (Robotics),2-s2.0-85044454951

Methods to extract information from patients' own immune reactions would be of great use for both diagnosis and treatment. Dengue fever is one of the diseases that clinical aggravations could occur paradoxically after humoral immunity appears. This property makes dengue fever an excellent disease model to explore. A principal component analyses (PCAs)-based framework derived from a prior vaccination study was developed. The framework was verified by successful demonstrations of known IgG signatures from a Mexico Dengue data set. Afterward the pipeline was tested upon de novo IgG and IgA libraries of Dengue patients from southern Taiwan. We discovered four infection signatures within IgG repertoires, two of which were identical to previous reports. However, it was IgA but not IgG that could differentiate hemorrhagic from non-hemorrhagic patients. IgA repertoires were found more diversified among bleeders, from whom seven signature clusters were characterized. The expressions of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) and accordingly mediated class-switch activity of IgA were distinct only among the PCA-segregated bleeding group. In sum, intercontinental sharing of IgG signatures in dengue fever was demonstrated via a unified working flow. Differential regulation of IgA class-switch with associated diversity expansion plus existences of hemorrhage-restricted clusters were shown. The ability of the framework to find common IgG signatures would implicate applications to infections even from unknown pathogens. The clusters within IgA repertoires could offer perspectives to other IgA-related bleeding disorders such as Henoch-Sch?nlein purpura or IgA nephropathy. Substantiated grounds for IgA-specific effector function via TGFβ1-mediated class-switch would be a new factor to consider for infectious diseases. ? 2017 Huang, Chang, Lin, Wang, Kuan, Hsieh, Wang, Yang, Chiu, Tsai, Chen and Liu.",Class-switch; Dengue fever; Hemorrhage; IgA; IgG; Immune repertoire; TGFβ,immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; Article; bioinformatics; bleeding; blood sampling; dengue; Dengue virus; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; hepatitis B; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; phenotype; principal component analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; serotyping; support vector machine; TGF beta signaling; virus infection,2-s2.0-85036640703

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data came from the longitudinal cohort Beaver Dam Eye Study (March 1, 1988, through September 15, 1990, and March 1, 1993, through June 15, 1995) and the Beaver Dam Offspring Study (June 8, 2005, through August 4, 2008, and July 12, 2010, through March 21, 2013). These population-based studies examined residents of Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, aged 43 to 84 years in 1987 through 1988 and their adult offspring aged 21 to 84 years in 2005 through 2008. A total of 4819 participants were at risk for developing AMD based on fundus images obtained at baseline visits. Data were analyzed from February 18, 2016, through June 22, 2017, with additional analyses ending September 22, 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Fundus imageswere graded for AMD using the Wisconsin Age-related Maculopathy Grading System. The incidence of AMD was defined as the presence at the 5-year follow-up examination of pure geographic atrophy or exudative macular degeneration, any type of drusen with pigmentary abnormalities, or soft indistinct drusen without pigmentary abnormalities. RESULTS Among the 4819 participants, the mean (SD) baseline age of the cohort was 54 (11) years; 2117 were men (43.9%) and 2702 were women (56.1%). The 5-year age- and sex-adjusted incidence of AMD was 8.8% in the Greatest Generation (born during 1901-1924), 3.0% in the Silent Generation (born during 1925-1945), 1.0% in the Baby Boom Generation (born during 1946-1964), and 0.3%in Generation X (born during 1965-1984). Adjusting for age and sex, each generation was more than 60%less likely to develop AMD than the previous generation (relative risk, 0.34; 95%CI, 0.24-0.46). The generational association (relative risk, 0.40; 95%CI, 0.28 to 0.57) remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, educational attainment, exercise, levels of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, and multivitamins. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The 5-year risk for AMD declined by birth cohorts throughout the 20th century. Factors that explain this decline in risk are not known. However, this pattern is consistent with reported declines in risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia, suggesting that aging Baby Boomers may experience better retinal health at older ages than did previous generations. ? 2017 American Medical Association.

In cirrhotic patient, the massive CL is even more intractable and extremely dangerous due to portal hypertension. Patients concerns: A 54-year-old liver cirrhotic patient had milky fluid leakage from left neck drainage tube after neck dissection surgery and hypopharyngeal cancer ablation. Electrolyte imbalance and shock status were reported when conservative managements and exploratory surgical repair failed to terminate the leakage. Diagnosis: Massive CL up to>5L/day was recorded on the post-operative day (POD) 9. Interventions: A triangular-shaped pectoralis major (PM) muscle was designed to repair the lymph nodes dissected defect over left neck. Outcomes: After surgery, CL dramatically reduced to less than 300mL/day in the coming day without relapses and terminated on the 8th days. After 3 months, the wound completely healed and the food conduit passage was patent without fistula.

Studies have indicated an increase in the incidence of IBS in Asia. However, yet the pathophysiology of this disease remains unknown. Women are more likely to develop the condition than men, especially the constipation-predominant type. Essential fatty acid (EFA) malnutrition is one of several theories discussing the mechanism of IBS. The authors hypothesized that significant EFA deficiency may cause abdominal pain in patients with IBS. However, because patterns in the oral intake of EFAs differ between cultures, the authors narrowed this study to examine the nutritional status of Asian female patients with IBS The authors investigated Asian female patients with IBS and compared them with a group of healthy controls. Thirty patients with IBS and 39 healthy individuals were included in this study. The participants' age, height, weight, and waist size were recorded. The 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was documented. Both erythrocyte and plasma fatty acid content were analyzed through gas-liquid chromatography. The authors found that patients with IBS exhibited significantly higher scores for depression, higher proportions of plasma saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids, and lower proportions of docosahexaenoic acid and total omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in plasma are associated with IBS in Asian female patients.

Methods: In a retrospective population of 114 NSCLC patients who received radiotherapy, a three-component neural networks framework was developed for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) of dose fractionation adaptation. Large-scale patient characteristics included clinical, genetic, and imaging radiomics features in addition to tumor and lung dosimetric variables. First, a generative adversarial network (GAN) was employed to learn patient population characteristics necessary for DRL training from a relatively limited sample size. Second, a radiotherapy artificial environment (RAE) was reconstructed by a deep neural network (DNN) utilizing both original and synthetic data (by GAN) to estimate the transition probabilities for adaptation of personalized radiotherapy patients' treatment courses. Third, a deep Q-network (DQN) was applied to the RAE for choosing the optimal dose in a response-adapted treatment setting. This multicomponent reinforcement learning approach was benchmarked against real clinical decisions that were applied in an adaptive dose escalation clinical protocol. In which, 34 patients were treated based on avid PET signal in the tumor and constrained by a 17.2% normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) limit for RP2. The uncomplicated cure probability (P+) was used as a baseline reward function in the DRL. Results: Taking our adaptive dose escalation protocol as a blueprint for the proposed DRL (GAN + RAE + DQN) architecture, we obtained an automated dose adaptation estimate for use at ?2/3 of the way into the radiotherapy treatment course. By letting the DQN component freely control the estimated adaptive dose per fraction (ranging from 1-5 Gy), the DRL automatically favored dose escalation/de-escalation between 1.5 and 3.8 Gy, a range similar to that used in the clinical protocol. The same DQN yielded two patterns of dose escalation for the 34 test patients, but with different reward variants. First, using the baseline P+ reward function, individual adaptive fraction doses of the DQN had similar tendencies to the clinical data with an RMSE = 0.76 Gy; but adaptations suggested by the DQN were generally lower in magnitude (less aggressive). Second, by adjusting the P+ reward function with higher emphasis on mitigating local failure, better matching of doses between the DQN and the clinical protocol was achieved with an RMSE = 0.5 Gy. Moreover, the decisions selected by the DQN seemed to have better concordance with patients eventual outcomes. In comparison, the traditional temporal difference (TD) algorithm for reinforcement learning yielded an RMSE = 3.3 Gy due to numerical instabilities and lack of sufficient learning. Conclusion: We demonstrated that automated dose adaptation by DRL is a feasible and a promising approach for achieving similar results to those chosen by clinicians. The process may require customization of the reward function if individual cases were to be considered. However, development of this framework into a fully credible autonomous system for clinical decision support would require further validation on larger multi-institutional datasets. ? 2017 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",adaptive radiotherapy; deep learning; lung cancer; reinforcement learning,Article; automation; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; clinical decision making; clinical protocol; dosimetry; human; learning algorithm; major clinical study; non small cell lung cancer; radiation dose escalation; radiation dose fractionation; retrospective study; artificial neural network; automation; lung tumor; Automation; Lung Neoplasms; Neural Networks (Computer),2-s2.0-85037829216

Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor contributing to increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Dual blood pressure (BP)-lowering and anti-inflammatory effect of renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) inhibitors may possess protective effect from MI in RA population. However, treatment of hypertension with RAS inhibitors and MI in RA population remains unclear. Methods: We investigated whether RAS blockade could decrease risk of incident MI in hypertensive patients with RA. We identified patients with RA and hypertension from the Registry for Catastrophic Illness, a nation-wide database encompassing almost all of the RA patients in Taiwan from 1995 to 2008. The primary endpoint was MI and the median duration of follow up was 2,986 days. Propensity score weighting and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios for MI. Results: Among 27,335 subjects, 9.9% received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), 25.9% received angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and 20.0% received ACEIs or ARBs alternatively. The incidence of MI significantly decreased in patients treated with ACEIs (hazard ratio 0.707; 95% confidence interval 0.595–0.840), ARBs (0.641; 0.550–0.747) and ACEIs/ARBs (0.631; 0.539–0.739). The protective effect of ACEI or ARB therapy was significantly better in patients taking longer duration. The effect remained robust in subgroup analyses. Conclusions: Therapy of ACEIs or ARBs is associated with a lower risk of MI among patients with RA. Hence, hypertension in patients with RA could comprise a compelling indication for RAS inhibitors. ? 2017 Lin et al.

A totally of 60 healthy subjects included 30 male and 30 female adults of age-matched were recruited and performed a vocal loading task to trigger a mild inflammation of the vocal cords in this study. In the results of oxidative metabolism, the vocal cords expressed hypoxia after vocal loading task in both male and female groups that could provide relevant information on the relationship between tissue oxygen consumption and supply for vocal cords diagnosis. Additionally, the results of optical acoustic assessment revealed the worse/changes voice quality after vocal loading task. Therefore, integration of non-invasive oxidative metabolism detection and acoustic assessment by using optical technique could provide more relevant information for diagnosis of voice disorders.

The goal is to estimate the electrical properties of living tissues by measuring the potential at the boundary of the domain. Being safe with respect to patient health, noninvasive, and having no known hazards, EIT is an attractive and promising technology. However, it suffers from a particular technical difficulty, which consists of solving a nonlinear inverse problem in real time. Several nonlinear approaches have been proposed as a replacement for the linear solver, but in practice very few are capable of stable, high-quality, and real-time EIT imaging because of their very low robustness to errors and inaccurate modeling, or because they require considerable computational effort. Methods: In this paper, a post-processing technique based on an artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed to obtain a nonlinear solution to the inverse problem, starting from a linear solution. While common reconstruction methods based on ANNs estimate the solution directly from the measured data, the method proposed here enhances the solution obtained from a linear solver. Conclusion: Applying a linear reconstruction algorithm before applying an ANN reduces the effects of noise and modeling errors. Hence, this approach significantly reduces the error associated with solving 2D inverse problems using machine-learning-based algorithms. Significance: This work presents radical enhancements in the stability of nonlinear methods for biomedical EIT applications. ? 2017 Martin, Choi.

Most cases are detected at advanced stages, resulting in poor prognosis. Therefore, improved detection of early oral health disorders is indispensable. The involvement of oral bacteria in inflammation and their association with OSCC progression provide a feasible target for diagnosis. Due to the nature of oral neoplasms, the diagnosis of epithelial precursor lesions is relatively easy compared with that of other types of cancer. However, the transition from an epithelial precursor lesion to cancer is slow and requires further and continuous follow-up. In this study, we investigated microbiota differences between normal individuals, epithelial precursor lesion patients, and cancer patients with different lifestyle habits, such as betel chewing and smoking, using next-generation sequencing. Overall, the oral microbiome compositions of five genera, Bacillus, Enterococcus, Parvimonas, Peptostreptococcus, and Slackia, revealed significant differences between epithelial precursor lesion and cancer patients and correlated with their classification into two clusters. These composition changes might have the potential to constitute a biomarker to help in monitoring the oral carcinogenesis transition from epithelial precursor lesion to cancer. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"RNA 16S; biodiversity; biology; disease predisposition; female; human; male; metagenomics; microbiology; microflora; mouth mucosa; mouth tumor; pathology; procedures; saliva; squamous cell carcinoma; Taiwan; Biodiversity; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Computational Biology; Disease Susceptibility; Female; Humans; Male; Metagenomics; Microbiota; Mouth Mucosa; Mouth Neoplasms; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Saliva; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85036516973

Confidence interval and sample size procedures are available for studying regression-based reference limits. However, the existing popular methods employ different technical simplifications and are applicable only in certain limited situations. This paper describes exact confidence intervals of regression-based reference limits and compares the exact approach with the approximate methods under a wide range of model configurations. Using the ratio between the widths of confidence interval and reference interval as the relative precision index, optimal sample size procedures are presented for precise interval estimation under expected ratio and tolerance probability considerations. Simulation results show that the approximate interval methods using normal distribution have inaccurate confidence limits. The exact confidence intervals dominate the approximate procedures in one- and two-sided coverage performance. Unlike the current simplifications, the proposed sample size procedures integrate all key factors including covariate features in the optimization process and are suitable for various regression-based reference limit studies with potentially diverse configurations. The exact interval estimation has theoretical and practical advantages over the approximate methods. The corresponding sample size procedures and computing algorithms are also presented to facilitate the data analysis and research design of regression-based reference limits. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Percentile; Precision; Quantile; Reference limit; Sample size,"Approximation theory; Financial data processing; Normal distribution; Percentile; Precision; Quantile; Reference limit; Sample sizes; Regression analysis; algorithm; Article; intermethod comparison; medical research; multiple linear regression analysis; normal distribution; priority journal; reference value; regression based reference limit; response variable; sample size; human; infant; newborn; regression analysis; reproducibility; standards; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Algorithms; Biomedical Research; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Models, Statistical; Regression Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Sample Size",2-s2.0-85032273136

In practices, the noise would greatly reduce the performance of BCIs. In this study, minima controlled recursive averaging is applied to suppress noise and improve the performance of practical BCI applications. Minima controlled recursive averaging is used to correctively track the noise. To suppress these noises, a log-spectral amplitude estimator is selected as the gain function and used to effectively estimate the power spectrum of the noises. Eight subjects were asked to attend a performance test of the proposed approach and the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was adopted to compare the proposed approach.

Lasers can contribute to minimizing the invasiveness of ENT surgery. The aim of this retrospective study is to compare in patients who underwent diode laser-assisted versus traditional VN in terms of operative time, surgical field, quality of life, and postoperative complications. All patients had refractory rhinitis with a poor treatment response to a 6-month trial of corticosteroid nasal sprays and underwent endoscopic VN between November 2006 and September 2015. They were non-randomly allocated into either a cold instrument group or a diode laser-assisted group. Vidian nerve was excised with a 940-nm continuous wave diode laser through a 600-μm silica optical fiber, utilizing a contact mode with the power set at 5?W. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to grade the severity of the rhinitis symptoms for quality of life assessment before the surgery and 6?months after. Of the 118 patients enrolled in the study, 75 patients underwent cold instrument VN and 43 patients underwent diode laser-assisted VN. Patients in the laser-assisted group had a significantly lower surgical field score and a lower postoperative bleeding rate than those in the cold instrument group. Changes in the VAS were significant in preoperative and postoperative nasal symptoms in each group. The application of diode lasers for vidian nerve transection showed a better surgical field and a lower incidence of postoperative hemorrhage. Recent advancements in laser application and endoscopic technique has made VN safer and more effective. We recommend this surgical approach as a reliable and effective treatment for patients with refractory rhinitis. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd.",Diode laser; Endoscopic vidian neurectomy; Refractory rhinitis; Surgical field; Visual analog scale,"corticosteroid; glass fiber; nose spray; polyvinyl alcohol sponge; silicon dioxide; adult; Article; chronic rhinitis; clinical assessment; corticosteroid therapy; disease severity; dry eye; endoscopic surgery; epistaxis; female; human; laser surgery; major clinical study; male; neurectomy; nose disease; operation duration; paresthesia; postoperative complication; postoperative hemorrhage; priority journal; quality of life; quality of life assessment; quasi experimental study; reliability; retrospective study; surgical approach; surgical technique; treatment response; vidian nerve; visual analog scale; adolescent; demography; denervation; diode laser; endoscopy; geniculate ganglion; middle aged; procedures; rhinitis; sphenoid sinus; Adolescent; Adult; Demography; Denervation; Endoscopy; Female; Geniculate Ganglion; Humans; Lasers, Semiconductor; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Rhinitis; Sphenoid Sinus; Visual Analog Scale",2-s2.0-85030312226

To improve the targeting selectivity to the region of disease sites, we developed protease-activated pro-antibodies by masking the binding sites of antibodies with inhibitory domains that can be removed by proteases that are highly expressed at the disease sites. The latency-associated peptide (LAP), C2b or CBa of complement factor 2/B were linked, through a substrate peptide of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), to an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody and an anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) antibody. Results showed that all the inhibitory domains could be removed by MMP-2 to restore the binding activities of the antibodies. LAP substantially reduced (53.8%) the binding activity of the anti-EGFR antibody on EGFR-expressing cells, whereas C2b and CBa were ineffective (21% and 9.3% reduction, respectively). Similarly, LAP also blocked 53.9% of the binding activity of the anti-TNF-α antibody. Finally, molecular dynamic simulation showed that the masking efficiency of LAP, C2b and CBa was 33.7%, 10.3% and-5.4%, respectively, over the binding sites of the antibodies. This strategy may aid in designing new protease-activated pro-antibodies that attain high therapeutic potency yet reduced systemic on-target toxicity. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; gelatinase A; matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor; monoclonal antibody; peptide hydrolase; protein binding; tumor necrosis factor; antagonists and inhibitors; antibody specificity; binding site; chemistry; drug effect; enzyme activation; human; immunology; molecular model; protein conformation; protein domain; protein stability; structure activity relation; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibody Specificity; Binding Sites; Enzyme Activation; ErbB Receptors; Humans; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors; Models, Molecular; Peptide Hydrolases; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Protein Stability; Structure-Activity Relationship; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",2-s2.0-85029491187

Here we show a carbon-based nanomaterial nanodiamond (ND) that carried paclitaxel (PTX), a microtubule inhibitor, and cetuximab (Cet), a specific monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), inducing mitotic catastrophe and tumor inhibition in human colorectal cancer (CRC). ND-PTX blocked the mitotic progression, chromosomal separation, and induced apoptosis in the CRC cells; however, NDs did not induce these effects. Conjugation of ND-PTX with Cet (ND-PTX-Cet) was specifically binding to the EGFR-positive CRC cells and enhanced the mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis induction. Besides, ND-PTX-Cet markedly decreased tumor size in the xenograft EGFR-expressed human CRC tumors of nude mice. Moreover, ND-PTX-Cet induced the mitotic marker protein phospho-histone 3 (Ser10) and apoptotic protein active-caspase 3 for mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis. Taken together, this study demonstrated that the co-delivery of PTX and Cet by ND enhanced the effects of mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, which may be applied in the human CRC therapy. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"antineoplastic agent; cetuximab; drug carrier; epidermal growth factor receptor; nanodiamond; paclitaxel; animal; apoptosis; cell proliferation; cell survival; chemistry; colorectal tumor; disease model; drug delivery system; drug effect; drug screening; gene expression; genetics; human; metabolism; mitosis; neoplasm; pathology; tumor cell line; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Cetuximab; Colorectal Neoplasms; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Carriers; Drug Delivery Systems; ErbB Receptors; Gene Expression; Humans; Mitosis; Nanodiamonds; Neoplasms; Paclitaxel; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-85028501456

MSI1 overexpression has been observed in several tumor tissues, including glioblastoma (GBM), and is considered as a well-established marker for tumor metastasis and recurrence. However, the molecular mechanisms by which MSI1 regulates cell migration are still undetermined. Here we reported that MSI1 alters cell morphology, promotes cell migration, and increases viscoelasticity of GBM cells. We also found that MSI1 directly binds to the 3′UTR of Tensin 3 (TNS3) mRNA, a negative regulator of cell migration, to inhibit its translation. Additionally, we identified that RhoA-GTP could be a potential regulator in MSI1/TNS3-mediated cell migration and morphological changes. In a xenograft animal model, high expression ratio of MSI1 to TNS3 enhanced GBM tumor migration. We also confirmed that MSI1 and TNS3 expressions are mutually exclusive in migratory tumor lesions, and GBM patients with MSI1high/TNS3low pattern tend to have poor clinical outcome. Taken together, our findings suggested a critical role of MSI1-TNS3 axis in regulating GBM migration and highlighted that the ratio of MSI1/TNS3 could predict metastatic and survival outcome of GBM patients. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"guanosine triphosphate; MSI1 protein, human; nerve protein; protein binding; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; RNA binding protein; tensin; TNS3 protein, human; 3' untranslated region; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cell adhesion; cell motion; cytoskeleton; disease exacerbation; elasticity; gene ontology; genetics; glioblastoma; human; male; metabolism; nude mouse; pathology; protein synthesis; signal transduction; tumor cell line; viscosity; 3' Untranslated Regions; Animals; Cell Adhesion; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cytoskeleton; Disease Progression; Elasticity; Gene Ontology; Glioblastoma; Guanosine Triphosphate; Humans; Male; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Protein Binding; Protein Biosynthesis; rhoA GTP-Binding Protein; RNA-Binding Proteins; Signal Transduction; Tensins; Viscosity",2-s2.0-85027835040

MicroRNA (miRNA) expression profiles are extensively used for discovering potential theranostic biomarkers of lung cancer. This work proposes an optimized support vector regression (SVR) method called SVR-LUAD to simultaneously identify a set of miRNAs referred to the miRNA signature for estimating the survival time of lung adenocarcinoma patients using their miRNA expression profiles. SVR-LUAD uses an inheritable bi-objective combinatorial genetic algorithm to identify a small set of informative miRNAs cooperating with SVR by maximizing estimation accuracy. SVR-LUAD identified 18 out of 332 miRNAs using 10-fold cross-validation and achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.88 ± 0.01 and mean absolute error of 0.56 ± 0.03 year between real and estimated survival time. SVR-LUAD performs well compared to some well-recognized regression methods. The miRNA signature consists of the 18 miRNAs which strongly correlates with lung adenocarcinoma: Hsa-let-7f-1, hsa-miR-16-1, hsa-miR-152, hsa-miR-217, hsa-miR-18a, hsa-miR-193b, hsa-miR-3136, hsa-let-7g, hsa-miR-155, hsa-miR-3199-1, hsa-miR-219-2, hsa-miR-1254, hsa-miR-1291, hsa-miR-192, hsa-miR-3653, hsa-miR-3934, hsa-miR-342, and hsa-miR-141.

Its goal is to image the electrical properties of human tissues. This approach is safe for the patient's health, is non-invasive and has no known hazards. However, the approach suffers from low accuracy. Linear inverse solvers are commonly used in medical applications, as they are strongly robust to noise. However, linear methods can give only an approximation of the solution that corresponds to a linear perturbation from an initial estimate. This paper proposes a novel reconstruction process. After applying a linear solver, the conductivity distribution is post-processed with a nonlinear algorithm, with the aim of reproducing the abrupt change in conductivity at the boundaries between tissues or organs. The results are used to compare the proposed method with three other widely used methods. The proposed method offers higher quality images and a higher robustness to noise, and significantly reduces the error associated with image reconstruction. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"algorithm; computer simulation; diagnostic imaging; human; image processing; imaging phantom; impedance; lung; procedures; three dimensional imaging; tomography; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Electric Impedance; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Lung; Phantoms, Imaging; Tomography",2-s2.0-85026738408

Class IIa HDACs are reportedly associated with some neuronal disorders, making HDACs therapeutic targets for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, some reported HDAC inhibitors contain hydroxamate moiety that chelates with zinc ion to become the cofactor of HDAC enzymes. However, the hydroxamate functional group is shown to cause undesirable effects and has poor pharmacokinetic profile. This study used in silico virtual screening methodology to identify several nonhydroxamate compounds, obtained from National Cancer Institute database, which potentially inhibited HDAC4. Comparisons of the enzyme inhibitory activity against a panel of HDAC isoforms revealed these compounds had strong inhibitory activity against class IIa HDACs, but weak inhibitory activity against class I HDACs. Further analysis revealed that a single residue affects the cavity size between class I and class IIa HDACs, thus contributing to the selectivity of HDAC inhibitors discovered in this study. The discovery of these inhibitors presents the possibility of developing new therapeutic treatments that can circumvent the problems seen in traditional hydroxamate-based drugs. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"histone deacetylase; histone deacetylase inhibitor; isoenzyme; protein binding; biocatalysis; chemical structure; chemistry; computer simulation; drug effect; human; metabolism; molecular model; preclinical study; procedures; protein domain; Biocatalysis; Computer Simulation; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Histone Deacetylases; Humans; Isoenzymes; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; Protein Binding; Protein Domains",2-s2.0-85020722385

Cancer stem cell (CSC) lineages are associated with tumour transformation, progression, and malignant transformation. However, how lineages are transformed and how chemoresistance is acquired by CRCs remain largely unknown. In this report, we demonstrated that the RNA-binding protein Musashi-1 enhanced the development of CD44+ colorectal CSCs and triggered the formation of anti-apoptotic stress granules (SGs). Our results indicated that CD44+ CSC lineage-specific induction of tumour malignancies was controlled by Musashi-1. In addition, Musashi-1 formed SGs when CRC cell lines were treated with 5-fluorouracil. The C-terminal domain of Musashi-1 was critical for recruitment of Musashi-1 into SGs. Intracellular Musashi-1 SGs enhanced the chemoresistance of CRCs. Analysis of clinical CRC samples indicated that Musashi-1 expression was prominent in CRC stage IIA and IIB. In summary, we demonstrated that Musashi-1, a stemness gene, is a critical modulator that promotes the development of CD44+ colorectal CSCs and also enhances CRC chemoresistance via formation of SGs.

The study included 4,075 participants aged 20-69 years from the 1999-2004 data of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The associations among MAC, gender differences, and high-frequency and low-frequency hearing thresholds were analyzed. We found that current female drinkers with MAC tended to have lower hearing thresholds. There is a significant protective effect of MAC on hearing threshold shifts in the US adult population, especially in females. Our research was the first study to further indicate that there is a gender difference in the association between MAC and hearing impairment. In accordance with our results, if people drink, they should consume moderate rather than higher amounts, especially in women, which may result in a reduced risk of hearing loss. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,biological marker; adult; aged; auditory threshold; cross-sectional study; drinking behavior; female; hearing; hearing impairment; human; male; middle aged; questionnaire; young adult; Adult; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Auditory Threshold; Biomarkers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hearing; Hearing Loss; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85019903421

To accommodate potentially time-varying covariate effects, we extend a varying-coefficient subdistribution regression model to recurrent event analysis and propose associated estimation procedures. The inverse probability of censoring weighting technique is employed to ensure consistent estimation of the regression parameter. Asymptotic distributional theory is derived for the proposed estimator. Simulation results confirm that the proposed estimator performs well in finite samples.

The associations between variables and MIRs were analyzed by linear regression analyses and the 57 countries were selected according to their data quality. RESULTS The more developed regions showed high gastric cancer incidence and mortality crude rates, but lower MIR values than the less developed regions (0.64 vs 0.80, respectively). Among six continents, Oceania had the lowest (0.60) and Africa had the highest (0.91) MIR. A good WHO ranking and a high e/GDP were significantly associated with low MIRs (p = 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively).

In fact, sensorimotor control contributes almost all kinds of human motions and it allows humans to adapt their motions to self-body sensations and environmental variations1. However, most existing approaches generate or simulate motions independent of perceptions, and thus the types of the motions that these methods can generate are much fewer than those performed by humans. We propose a sensorimotor control framework to simulate perception-aware motions in this study. In particular, we simulate motion sickness, which is a typical perception-aware motion that induces the postural instability caused by the impairments in the function of the vestibular system.",Character animation; Motion generation; Motoin sickness; Motor control; Sensorimotor; Vestibular system,Animation; Interactive computer graphics; Character animation; Motion generation; Motoin sickness; Motor control; Sensorimotor; Vestibular system; Diseases,2-s2.0-85041344948

Meanwhile, age per sec is an unfavorable determinant that has an impact on liver-related outcomes. Geriatric chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients would be viewed as a special population and have an urgent need for viral eradication. Areas covered: The antivirals for CHC have evolved from interferon (IFN)-based therapyto interferon-free DAAs. The treatment strategy, in terms of its clinical efficacy and drug safety, in the elderly is presented. Expert opinion: In the previous IFN era, the sustained virological response (SVR) rate of the elderly was lower. More unfavorable safety concerns attributing to the underlying liver disease severity and extra-hepatic presentations further compromised the treatment efficacy. In the IFN-free DAA era, data showing similar SVR rates and safety profiles between the elderly and their counterparts have been demonstrated. Notably, aging is an unfavorable factor for fibrosis regression and HCC development even after HCV eradication. The extent of the improvement of extra-hepatic manifestations in the elderly with SVR is also unclear. The long-term benefits of viral eradication by DAAs in the elderly await further explorations. ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",advanced age; DAA; elderly; HCV; IFN; treatment,antivirus agent; interferon; rivarin; unclassified drug; antivirus agent; aging; cancer risk; chronic kidney failure; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug interaction; drug response; drug safety; geriatric patient; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus genotype 3; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver fibrosis; Review; treatment outcome; viral clearance; aged; hepatitis C; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Hepatitis C; Humans,2-s2.0-85036566986

Despite the aggressiveness of TNBCs, targeted TNBC therapy is not yet available in the clinic. To overcome this challenge, we generated highly metastatic TNBC cells (LM) derived from metastasized lung cells via a serial spontaneous pulmonary metastasis animal model to identify targetable molecules for attenuating the progression of TNBC metastasis. Gene analysis of primary tumor (P), first-round (1LM) and second-round (2LM) metastasized lung cells revealed that mesenchymal-related genes were significantly expressed in LM cells, especially in 2LM cells. Interestingly, α9-nAChR gene expression was also dramatically induced in LM cells, confirming our previous finding that α9-nAChR plays important roles in receptormediated carcinogenic signals in human breast cancer development. Using α9-nAChR as a biomarker, we transfected 2LM cells with CRISPR/Cas9 lentivirus targeting the α9-nAChR genomic region (2LM-α9-nAChR-null), showing that mesenchymal markers and the migration and invasion abilities of 2LM cells were significantly attenuated in 2LM-α9-nAChR-null cells both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the high efficiency of editing the α9-nAChR gene using a CRISPR/Cas9 lentivirus was demonstrated by gene sequencing, genomic indel frequency and protein expression analyses. Collectively, these results confirmed those of our previous study that advanced-stage breast tumors are associated with substantially higher levels of α9-nAChR gene expression, indicating that α9-nAChR expression is essential for mediating TNBC metastasis during cancer development and may potentially act as a biomarker for targeted therapy in clinical investigations. ? 2017 Huang, Lin, Qiu, Lin, Hsu, Tam, Lee, Yang and Lee.",Cancer metastasis; Epithelial-mesenchymal transition; Gene editing; Triple-negative breast cancer; α9-nAChR,alpha smooth muscle actin; nerve cell adhesion molecule; nicotinic receptor; nicotinic receptor alpha 9; transcription factor Slug; transcription factor Snail; transcription factor ZEB1; unclassified drug; uvomorulin; vimentin; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer growth; cell invasion; cell migration; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; flow cytometry; gene expression; gene locus; gene sequence; human; human cell; lung metastasis; MDA-MB-231 cell line; mouse; nonhuman; real time polymerase chain reaction; restriction fragment length polymorphism; triple negative breast cancer; Western blotting; wound healing assay,2-s2.0-85040929595

Here we analyze cancer immunotherapy-related patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in the past decade (2006–2016). A total of 2,229 patents were identified in 13 subfields. The growth of patent number in this field has outpaced the background rate, with cytokine-related therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and natural killer cell therapies growing the most rapidly. The top 15 assignees possess 27.6% (616) of the patents. Amgen is the largest patent holder, followed by Novartis, and then by Chugai Seiyaku. The top assignees have focused on different subfields, and collaborated with each other for technology development. Our competitive analysis reveals that Novartis, Chugai Seiyaku, and Abbvie lead in both patent number and average quality of patents. Meanwhile, Immunomedics owns a high-quality though relatively small patent portfolio in single-chain variable fragment technology, which is not the focus of the abovementioned forerunners.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted, and medical records from 2012 to 2016 were reviewed. Patients who received concurrent DEX and ranibizumab injections with a follow-up period of at least 3 months were enrolled in the study group. An age and gender-matched group received ranibizumab injections and was designated the control group. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT) and intraocular pressure (IOP) were included in the analysis. Steroid-induced ocular hypertension (SIOH) is defined as either an elevation of more than 10 mmHg from baseline or a single IOP measurement of more than 30 mmHg. A total of 26 patients were enrolled in the current study with 13 patients in each group. Both the BCVA (P = .04) and CMT (P < .01) achieved significant improvement after the follow-up period in the study group. The IOP increased after the injection but no significant elevation was observed throughout the follow-up period in the study group (P = .15). For SIOH, 1 patient in the study group had an elevated IOP of 10 mmHg (7.7%) at 2 postoperative months, and no single IOP measurement of more than 30 mmHg was obtained. Five patients (38.5%) in the study group received medical treatment that successfully retarded their IOP elevation, and no individuals required surgical management. In the control group, there were no significant fluctuations concerning BCVA, CMT, and IOP, and no ocular hypertension was observed. According to the inter-group analysis, the CMT and BCVA recovered more significantly in the study group than in the control group. Concurrent injection of DEX and ranibizumab is a preliminary method that shows effectiveness in treating ME. Furthermore, safety is also guaranteed, with moderate levels of severity and transient IOP elevation being observed. A future large-scale study is necessary to evaluate the long-term effects and safety of this combined treatment. ? Copyright 2017 the Author(s).

The accumulation of uremic toxins in CKD induces oxidative stress andendothelial dysfunction. MicroRNA-92a (miR-92a) is inducedby oxidative stress in endothelial cells (ECs) and involved in angiogenesis and atherosclerosis.We investigated a role for oxidative stress-responsive miR-92a in CKD. Our study of patients at three clinical sites showed increased serum miR-92a level with decreased kidney function. In cultured ECs, human CKD serum or uremic toxins (such as indoxyl sulfate), compared with non-CKDserum, induced the levels ofmiR-92a and suppressedthe expression ofmiR-92a targets, includingkey endothelial-protectivemolecules.The antioxidantN-acetylcysteine inhibited these vasculopathic properties. In rats, adenine-induced CKD associated with increased levels of miR-92a in aortas, serum, and CD144+ endothelial microparticles. Furthermore, CD144+ microparticles from human uremic serum contained more miR-92a than those from control serum. Additional analysis showed a positive correlation between serumlevels ofmiR-92a and indoxyl sulfate in a cohort of patientswith ESRD undergoing hemodialysis. Collectively, our findings suggest that the uremic toxins accumulated in CKD can upregulate miR-92a in ECs, which impairs EC function and predisposes patients to CVD. ? 2017 by the American Society of Nephrology.",,"acetylcysteine; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; indican; kruppel like factor 2; kruppel like factor 4; microRNA; microRNA 92a; sirtuin 1; unclassified drug; uremic toxin; vascular endothelial cadherin; microRNA; MIRN92 microRNA, human; adult; Article; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; controlled study; down regulation; end stage renal disease; endothelial dysfunction; endothelial microparticle; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; gene expression; gene function; gene repression; gene targeting; hemodialysis; human; human cell; human cell culture; immunoblotting; kidney function; major clinical study; male; middle aged; molecular pathology; multicenter study; oxidative stress; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein blood level; quantitative analysis; umbilical vein endothelial cell; upregulation; animal; blood; chronic kidney failure; clinical trial; endothelium cell; pathophysiology; physiology; rat; Wistar rat; Animals; Endothelial Cells; Female; Humans; Male; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic",2-s2.0-85032641505

The way in which the motor seizures present themselves is not very different from most of the generalized seizures in and between epilepsy patients. This might point towards the involvement of motor-related cortices and corticospinal pathway for wide spread propagation of epileptic activity. Our aim was to identify changes in the cerebral structures and to correlate clinical variables with structural changes particularly in the motor-related cortices and pathway of patients with generalized convulsions from different seizure foci. Methods Sixteen patients with focal onset and secondarily generalized seizures were included, along with sixteen healthy volunteers. Structural differences were analysed by measuring grey matter (GM) volume and thickness via T1-weighted MRI, and white matter (WM) fractional anisotropy (FA) via diffusion tensor imaging. GM and WM microstructural properties were compared between patients and controls by voxel- and surface- based analyses. Next, morphometric findings were correlated with seizure severity and disease duration to identify the pathologic process. Key findings In addition to widely reduced GM and WM properties, increased GM volume in the bilateral precentral gyri and paracentral lobules, and elevated regional FA in the bilateral corticospinal tracts adjacent to these motor -related GM were observed in patients and with higher statistical difference in the sub-patient group with drug-resistance. Significance The increment of GM volume and WM FA in the motor pathway positively correlated with severity and duration of epilepsy. The demonstrated microstructural changes of motor pathways imply a plastic process of motor networks in the patients with frequent generalization of focal seizures. ? 2017 The Authors",Cortical thickness; Fractional anisotropy; Gray matter volume; Motor pathways; Secondarily generalized seizures,"adolescent; adult; Article; brain size; child; clinical article; controlled study; cortical thickness (brain); diffusion tensor imaging; disease association; disease duration; disease severity; drug resistant epilepsy; female; focal epilepsy; fractional anisotropy; gray matter; human; male; middle aged; morphology; motor system; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; preschool child; primary motor cortex; priority journal; pyramidal tract; retrospective study; school child; secondarily generalized neocortical seizure; structure analysis; surface property; tonic clonic seizure; voxel based morphometry; white matter; young adult; brain; diagnostic imaging; efferent nerve; generalized epilepsy; gray matter; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pathology; severity of illness index; three dimensional imaging; white matter; Adolescent; Adult; Brain; Child; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Efferent Pathways; Epilepsy, Generalized; Female; Gray Matter; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Size; Severity of Illness Index; White Matter; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85029818976

Because of its low toxicity, broad-spectrum activity, and good bioavailability, rifampin is now commonly administered as combination antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of various infections caused by organisms other than mycobacteria. This review summarizes the most recent clinical studies on the use of rifampin combinations for treating four common non-mycobacterial infections: acute bacterial meningitis, infective endocarditis and bacteraemia, pneumonia, and biofilm-related infections. Methods We performed a literature search of clinical studies published in English from January 2005 to June 2016 using the PubMed database with the search terms “rifampin” with “meningitis” or “infective endocarditis and bacteraemia” or “pneumonia” or “prosthetic joint infections. Results Current evidence to support a rifampin combination therapy as a treatment for non-mycobacterial infections was largely based on in vitro/in vivo studies and non-comparable retrospective case series. Additionally, controlled clinical trials that directly compared outcomes resulting from rifampin treatment versus treatment without rifampin were limited. Conclusions Rifampin combination therapy appears promising for the treatment of non-mycobacterial infections. However, further definitive clinical trials are necessary to validate its use because the risk of adverse drug–drug interactions and of the emergence of rifampin resistance during treatment may outweigh the potential benefits. ? 2017 The British Infection Association",Bacteremia; Bacterial meningitis; Biofilm-related infection; Cardiovascular infection; Multidrug-resistant organisms; Pneumonia; Rifampin,ampicillin; cephalosporin; colistin; daptomycin; imipenem; meropenem; penicillin derivative; rifampicin; sulbactam; vancomycin; antiinfective agent; rifampicin; bacteremia; bacterial endocarditis; bacterial meningitis; clinical study; disease association; hospital acquired pneumonia; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; mycobacteriosis; nonhuman; periprosthetic joint infection; pneumonia; practice guideline; Review; Staphylococcus infection; Streptococcus pneumoniae; ventilator associated pneumonia; bacterial infection; mycobacteriosis; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacterial Infections; Humans; Mycobacterium Infections; Rifampin,2-s2.0-85029581641

Objective The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that ICNA and SKNA correlate with postoperative cardiac arrhythmias in humans. Methods Eleven patients (mean age 60 ± 13 years; 4 women) were enrolled in this study. Electrical signals were simultaneously recorded from electrocardiogram (ECG) patch electrodes on the chest wall and from 2 temporary pacing wires placed during open heart surgery on the left atrial epicardial fat pad. The signals were filtered to display SKNA and ICNA. Premature atrial contractions (PACs) and premature ventricular contractions were determined manually. The SKNA and ICNA of the first 300 minutes of each patient were calculated minute by minute to determine baseline average amplitudes of nerve activities and to determine their correlation with arrhythmia burden. Results We processed 1365 ± 973 minutes of recording per patient. Low-amplitude SKNA and ICNA were present at all time, while the burst discharges were observed much less frequently. Both SKNA and burst ICNA were significantly associated with the onset of PACs and premature ventricular contractions. Baseline average ICNA (aICNA), but not average SKNA, had a significant association with PAC burden. The correlation coefficient (r) between aICNA and PAC burden was 0.78 (P <.01).

Study design We performed a screening trial to assess all newborns who underwent routine newborn metabolic screening at the National Taiwan University Hospital newborn screening center between November 2014 and September 2016. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) genotyping assay for the SMN1/SMN2 intron 7 c.888+100A/G polymorphism was performed to detect homozygous SMN1 deletion using dried blood spot (DBS) samples. Then the exon 7 c.840C>T mutation and SMN2 copy number were determined by both droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) using the original screening DBS and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) using a whole blood sample. Results Of the 120 267 newborns, 15 tested positive according to the RT-PCR assay. The DBS ddPCR assay excluded 8 false-positives, and the other 7 patients were confirmed by the MLPA assay. Inclusion of the second-tier DBS ddPCR screening assay resulted in a positive prediction value of 100%. The incidence of SMA was 1 in 17 181 (95% CI, 1 in 8323 to 1 in 35 468). Two of the 3 patients with 2 copies of SMN2 and all 4 patients with 3 or 4 copies of SMN2 were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Five of the 8 false-positives were caused by intragenic recombination between SMN1 and SMN2. Conclusion Newborn screening can detect patients affected by SMA before symptom onset and enable early therapeutic intervention. A combination of a RT-PCR and a second-tier ddPCR can accurately diagnose SMA from DBS samples with no false-positives.

In this design, the robot motion is a resultant of autonomous navigation and compliant motion control. The compliance motion controller allows the robot to possess passive behavior following the motion intent of the user, while the autonomous guidance gives safe navigation of the robot without colliding with any obstacles. A shared-control approach is suggested to combine the passive compliant behavior and safe guidance of the robot. When a user exerts force to the robot, the mobile platform responds to adjust the speed in compliance with the user movement. On the other hand, the autonomous navigation controller is designed to provide collision-free guidance. Using the developed shared controller, outputs of the compliance motion controller and autonomous navigation controller are fused to generate appropriate motion for the robot. In this manner, passive behavior allows the walking-assistant robot to adapt to a user's motion intent and move in compliance with user. Meanwhile, the active guidance adjusts the linear velocity and the direction of the robot in real time in response to the environmental data received from the on-board laser scanner. The developed algorithms have been implemented on a self-constructed walking-assistant robot. Experimental results validate the proposed design and demonstrate that the robot can actively avoid unexpected obstacles while move passively following the user to the destination. ? 2017 IEEE.",Assistive device; motion control; robot control; service robot; shared control,Air navigation; Compliance control; Controllers; Machine design; Motion control; Navigation; Walking aids; Autonomous guidance; Autonomous navigation; Compliant behavior; Compliant motion control; Environmental data; Indoor environment; Motion controller; Walking assistant robots; Robots,2-s2.0-85008440052

Only a few nationwide studies regarding the surveillance and epidemiology of human QF have been reported. Although QF is endemic in Taiwan, a nationwide database investigation of the epidemiology and characteristics of QF and its associations with scrub typhus (ST), murine typhus (MT) and leptospirosis (LS) has never been reported. We analysed nationwide databases of suspected QF, ST, MT and LS cases from October 2007 to December 2014 obtained from the Centers for Disease Control, Taiwan. A total of 468 (4.2%) QF cases were identified among 11?109 suspected QF cases. QF cases were mainly distributed in the southern and Kaohsiung–Pingtung regions but rarely in the eastern region. Compared to non-QF cases, QF cases had significantly higher percentages of males (88.7 versus 66.2%) and high-risk occupations (farming, animal husbandry or veterinary medicine) (16.2 versus 10.5%). But the percentages of specific animal contact, including cattle (0.6 versus 0.8%) and goats (0.9 versus 1.0%), were low in both. The majority of suspected QF cases (89.4%) were simultaneously suspected with ST, MT or LS, and the combinations of suspected diseases differed between regions. The number of suspected QF cases from the eastern region decreased since 2009, which was not observed in other regions. A total of 1420 (12.8%) cases had confirmed diseases, including QF (453, 4.1%), QF+ST (7, 0.06%), QF+MT (4, 0.04%), QF+LS (4, 0.04%), MT (186, 1.7%), ST (545, 4.9%), ST+LS (11, 0.1%) and LS (210, 1.9%). Compared to cases of unknown disease, QF cases had larger percentages of high-risk occupations (16.2 versus 9.6%) but similar histories of animal contact (29.8 versus 25.1%). QF is an endemic disease in southern Taiwan. It is difficult to differentiate QF from ST, MT or LS only by high-risk occupations and history of animal contact, and co-infection of QF with these diseases should be considered. ? 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",co-infection; leptospirosis; murine typhus; Q fever; scrub typhus; Taiwan,"adult; agricultural worker; animal husbandry; Article; disease association; female; geographic distribution; high risk patient; high risk population; human; laboratory test; leptospirosis; major clinical study; male; medical history; middle aged; mixed infection; murine typhus; nonhuman; occupation; priority journal; Q fever; scrub typhus; Taiwan; veterinary medicine; aged; animal; Coinfection; complication; factual database; leptospirosis; microbiology; Q fever; scrub typhus; Typhus, Endemic Flea-Borne; zoonosis; Adult; Aged; Animals; Coinfection; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Leptospirosis; Male; Middle Aged; Q Fever; Scrub Typhus; Taiwan; Typhus, Endemic Flea-Borne; Zoonoses",2-s2.0-85008253781

This study aimed to investigate the association between GBS and the risk of developing psychiatric disorders. Methods A total of 18,192 enrolled patients, with 4548 study subjects who had suffered GBS, and 13,644 controls matched for gender and age, from the Inpatient Dataset of 2000–2013 in Taiwan, and selected from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). After adjusting for confounding factors, Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to compare the risk of developing psychiatric disorders during the 13 years of follow-up. Results Of the study subjects, 471 (10.35%) developed psychiatric disorders when compared to 1023 (7.50%) in the control group. Fine and Gray's competing risk model analysis revealed that the study subjects were more likely to develop psychiatric disorders (crude hazard ratio [HR]: 4.281 (95% CI = 3.819–4.798, p < 0.001). After adjusting for gender, age, monthly income, urbanization level, geographic region, and comorbidities, the adjusted HR was 4.320 (95% CI = 3.852–4.842, p < 0.001). Dementia, depressive disorders, sleep disorders, and psychotic disorders predominate in these psychiatric disorders. Mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis are associated with a lower risk of dementia when compared to the control groups. Conclusions Patients who suffered from GBS had a higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders, and this finding should act as a reminder to the clinicians that a regular psychiatric follow-up might well be needed for those patients. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Cohort study; Dementia; Depressive disorder; Guillain-Barre syndrome; National Health Insurance Research Database; Psychiatric disorders; Psychotic disorder; Sleep disorder,adult; aged; Article; artificial ventilation; autumn; cohort analysis; comorbidity; comparative study; controlled study; dementia; depression; female; Guillain Barre syndrome; hemodialysis; hospital; human; infection; major clinical study; male; mental disease; middle aged; plasma exchange; priority journal; psychosis; respiratory failure; risk factor; sleep disorder; spring; summer; Taiwan; thrombosis; urbanization; young adult; follow up; Guillain Barre syndrome; Kaplan Meier method; mental disease; proportional hazards model; risk; Adult; Aged; Comorbidity; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Guillain-Barre Syndrome; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk; Taiwan; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85027977897

This study aimed to update the epidemiology and antifungal susceptibility of non-albicans candidemia isolates from the cancer patients. Adult cancer patients with non-albicans candidemia were recruited, and clinical data were retrospectively collected from five medical centers in Taiwan from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2014. In vitro susceptibility was determined by the broth dilution method using a Sensititre YeastOne system and interpreted according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. A total of 346 episodes of non-albicans candidemia were identified in cancer patients. Candida tropicalis was the most common species (n=145, 41.9%) and had the highest resistance rate to fluconazole (n=17, 13.9%) among all the preserved isolates, including C. tropicalis, Candida glabrata and Candida parapsilosis. A higher Charlson comorbidity index, non-albicans candidemia due to C. tropicalis, neutropenia and septic shock were independent predictors of 28-day mortality. In conclusion, the species distribution and antifungal susceptibility of non-albicans candidemia isolates in our study differed from those in Western countries, providing useful information about local epidemiology for the selection of empirical antifungal agents for cancer patients. ? 2017 The Author(s).",cancer; epidemiology; non-albicans candidemia; susceptibility,"amphotericin B; anidulafungin; caspofungin; echinocandin; fluconazole; flucytosine; itraconazole; micafungin; posaconazole; triazole; voriconazole; antifungal agent; abdominal infection; adult; antifungal susceptibility; Article; breast cancer; broth dilution; cancer epidemiology; cancer patient; Candida; Candida dubliniensis; Candida famata; Candida glabrata; Candida parapsilosis; Candida sake; Candida tropicalis; candidemia; catheter infection; cerebrovascular accident; Charlson Comorbidity Index; chronic lung disease; Clavispora lusitaniae; congestive heart failure; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; digestive system cancer; end stage renal disease; female; fungus isolation; head and neck cancer; hematologic malignancy; human; in vitro study; liver cirrhosis; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; Meyerozyma guilliermondii; middle aged; neutropenia; Pichia kudriavzevii; Pichia norvegensis; practice guideline; primary infection; priority journal; septic shock; skin infection; soft tissue infection; Taiwan; urinary tract infection; urogenital tract cancer; Yarrowia lipolytica; antifungal resistance; Candida; candidemia; classification; clinical trial; complication; drug effect; isolation and purification; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; mortality; multicenter study; neoplasm; retrospective study; risk factor; Antifungal Agents; Candida; Candidemia; Drug Resistance, Fungal; Female; Humans; Male; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85031047577

Four distinct serotypes (DV1-4), which have similar genome sequences and envelope protein (E protein) antigenic properties, were divided. Among these 4 serotypes, DV1 usually causes predominant infections and fast diagnosis and effective treatments are urgently required to prevent further hospitalization and casualties. Methods: To develop antibodies specifically targeting and neutralizing DV1, we immunized mice with UV-inactivated DV1 viral particles and recombinant DV1 E protein from residue 1 to 395 (E395), and then generated 12 anti-E monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as the candidates for a series of characterized assays such as ELISA, dot blot, immunofluorescence assay, western blot, and foci forming analyses. Results: Among the mAbs, 10 out of 12 showed cross-reactivity to four DV serotypes as well as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in different cross-reactivity patterns. Two particular mAbs, DV1-E1 and DV1-E2, exhibited strong binding specificity and neutralizing activity against DV1 and showed no cross-reactivity to DV2, DV3, DV4 or JEV-infected cells as characterized by ELISA, dot blot, immunofluorescence assay, western blot, and foci forming analyses. Using peptide coated indirect ELISA, we localized the neutralizing determinants of the strongly inhibitory mAbs to a sequence-unique epitope on the later-ridge of domain III of the DV1 E protein, centered near residues T346 and D360 (346TQNGRLITANPIVTD360). Interestingly, the amino acid sequence of the epitope region is highly conserved among different genotypes of DV1 but diverse from DV2, DV3, DV4 serotypes and other flaviviruses. Conclusions: Our results showed two selected mAbs DV1-E1 and DV1-E2 can specifically target and significantly neutralize DV1. With further research these two mAbs might be applied in the development of DV1 specific serologic diagnosis and used as a feasible treatment option for DV1 infection. The identification of DV1 mAbs epitope with key residues can also provide vital information for vaccine design. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Dengue virus (DV); Envelope protein; Epitope; Monoclonal antibody,"epitope; glycoprotein E1; glycoprotein E2; monoclonal antibody; immunologic factor; monoclonal antibody; neutralizing antibody; virus antibody; amino acid sequence; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antibody screening; antigen binding; Article; controlled study; cross reaction; dengue; Dengue virus 1; dot hybridization; drug binding; drug research; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epitope mapping; female; focus forming assay; genotype; immunization; immunofluorescence test; Japanese encephalitis virus; laboratory test; mouse; nonhuman; virus neutralization; Western blotting; animal; Dengue virus; immunoassay; immunology; isolation and purification; procedures; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Dengue Virus; Epitope Mapping; Immunoassay; Immunologic Factors; Mice",2-s2.0-85030858797

The presence of these drugs and their metabolites in postmortem specimens has been routinely monitored in our laboratory mostly by gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric methods. This study aimed to evaluate a more effective approach to simultaneously quantify these analytes (i.e., amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), morphine, codeine, 6-acetylmorphine, 6-acetylcodeine, ketamine and norketamine) in postmortem urine and blood specimens by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Samples (1 mL) were extracted via solid-phase extraction, evaporated and reconstituted in the mobile phase for injection into the LC-MS-MS system. Respective deuterated analogs of these analytes were used as internal standards. Chromatographic separation was achieved by an Agilent Zorbax SB-Aq analytical column at 50°C. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed by electrospray ionization in positive-ion dynamic multiple reaction monitoring mode with optimized collision energy for respective precursor ion selected for each analyte, and the monitoring of two transition ions. Performance characteristics were assessed using drug-free samples that were fortified with 50-1,000 ng/mL of the 10 analytes. Analytical parameters evaluated and resulting data are as follows: (i) average extraction recoveries (n = 3) were better than 80%, except for MDMA (71%) and morphine (74%); (ii) inter-day and intra-day precision ranges (%CV) were 1.59-8.80% and 0.57-3.89%, respectively; (iii) calibration linearity (r2), detection limit and quantitation limit for all analytes were &gt;0.999, 1 and 5 ng/mL, respectively; (iv) matrix effects (ion suppression) were observed for three analytes, but were satisfactorily compensated for by the deuterated internal standards adopted in the analytical protocol. This method was successfully applied to the analysis of specimens collected from unknown death cases from various district prosecutors' offices in Taiwan, and was also found helpful to understanding whether the detected opiates were derived from heroin or legal morphine/codeine-containing medications. ?

Over 10% of the population is infected by influenza viruses every year, and the infection has caused losses to both health and the economy. Approximately three million free vaccine doses are ordered and administered to high-risk populations at the beginning of flu season to control the disease. The government recommends sharing and redistributing vaccine inventories when shortages occur. While this policy intends to increase inventory flexibility, and has been proven as widely valuable, its impact on vaccine availability has not been previously reported. Material and methods: This study developed an inventory model adapted to vaccination protocols to evaluate government recommended polices under different levels of vaccine production. Demands were uncertain and stratified by ages and locations according to the demographic data in Taiwan. Results: When vaccine supply is sufficient, sharing pediatric vaccine reduced vaccine unavailability by 43% and overstock by 54%, and sharing adult vaccine reduced vaccine unavailability by 9% and overstock by 15%. Redistributing vaccines obtained greater gains for both pediatrics and adults (by 75%). When the vaccine supply is in short, only sharing pediatric vaccine yielded a 48% reduction of unused inventory, while other polices do not improve performances. Conclusions: When implementing vaccination activities for seasonal influenza intervention, it is important to consider mismatches of demand and vaccine inventory. Our model confirmed that sharing and redistributing vaccines can substantially increase availability and reduce unused vaccines. ? 2017 Sheng-I Chen.

Methods At a tertiary teaching hospital, obstetric ultrasonography was performed at 28 weeks gestation to establish a diagnosis of grade III PPC. Weight gain during pregnancy was recorded at the same time. Pregnancies complicated with chronic hypertension, major fetal congenital anomalies, termination before 24 weeks gestation, and abortion before 20 weeks gestation were excluded. Results In the current cohort study, 20,103 pregnancies were enrolled and categorized as normal blood pressure (NBP; n = 18,223) and GH-PE (n = 1880) groups. According to severity of the diseases, the GH-PE group was further divided into GH (n = 1088), PE (n = 792), and severe PE (n = 209) groups. There were significant differences between the NBP and GH-PE groups in known factors, including maternal age, BMI, parity, multi-fetal pregnancy, and co-morbidities (all p < 0.001), all of which increased the risk for GH-PE. Regarding the progression of GH to PE and severe PE, there was a much greater frequency of excessive weight gain (51.2% and 49.0% vs. 9.3%) or PPC (63.2% and 61.6% vs. 12.1%) in the severe PE and PE groups than the GH group. Logistic regression analysis revealed that PPC was a significant and independent risk factor for progression of GH to PE (OR, 13.71; 95% CI, 10.25–18.33) and severe PE (OR, 12.42; 95% CI, 8.89–17.35), as well as excessive weight gain during pregnancy (OR, 8.92; 95% CI, 6.67–11.92 and OR, 10.25; 95% CI, 7.30–12.40). Conclusion Being a pathologic implication, the presence of PPC or excessive weight gain during pregnancy may precede progression of GH, and can serve as a warning or marker that requires closer surveillance for maternal and fetal well-being. Based on the findings of PPC and excessive weight gain, at-risk pregnant woman should be counseled to facilitate early intervention or referral. In addition, avoiding excessive weight gain during pregnancy may reduce the risk of GH progression to PE. ? 2017 International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy",Gestational hypertension; Pre-eclampsia; Pregnant weight gain; Preterm placental calcification,"adult; Article; body mass; calcification; cardiovascular risk; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; disease classification; disease course; disease severity; echography; female; gestational age; gestational weight gain; human; major clinical study; maternal age; maternal hypertension; multiple pregnancy; parity; placenta disorder; preeclampsia; pregnancy; priority journal; risk factor; teaching hospital; tertiary care center; body weight gain; disease exacerbation; maternal hypertension; pathophysiology; preeclampsia; pregnancy; prenatal diagnosis; severity of illness index; Taiwan; Adult; Cohort Studies; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced; Pre-Eclampsia; Pregnancy; Prenatal Diagnosis; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Taiwan; Weight Gain",2-s2.0-85031119066

Acting as a ligand for liver X receptor (LXR), but an inhibitor of SREBP2 (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2), 25-hydroxycholesterol, and its catalyzing enzyme cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (Ch25h) are important in regulating cellular inflammatory status and cholesterol biosynthesis in both ECs and monocytes/macrophages. METHODS: Bioinformatic analyses were used to investigate RNAsequencing data to identify cholesterol oxidation and efflux genes regulated by Kr?ppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). In vitro experiments involving cultured ECs and macrophages and in vivo methods involving mice with Ch25h ablation were then used to explore the atheroprotective role of KLF4-Ch25h/LXR. RESULTS: Vasoprotective stimuli increased the expression of Ch25h and LXR via KLF4. The KLF4-Ch25h/LXR homeostatic axis functions through suppressing inflammation, evidenced by the reduction of inflammasome activity in ECs and the promotion of M1 to M2 phenotypic transition in macrophages. The increased atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-/-/Ch25h-/- mice further demonstrates the beneficial role of the KLF4-Ch25h/LXR axis in vascular function and disease. CONCLUSIONS: KLF4 transactivates Ch25h and LXR, thereby promoting the synergistic effects between ECs and macrophages to protect against atherosclerosis susceptibility. ? 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.",Atherosclerosis; Cholesterol; Endothelial cells; Inflammation; Macrophages; Shear stress,apolipoprotein E; cholesterol; cholesterol 25 hydroxylase; cryopyrin; enzyme; inflammasome; kruppel like factor 4; liver X receptor; sterol regulatory element binding protein 2; unclassified drug; 25-hydroxycholesterol; cholesterol derivative; kruppel like factor; kruppel like factor 4; liver X receptor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; atherosclerosis; bioinformatics; blood vessel function; cell culture; cholesterol transport; controlled study; disease predisposition; genetic transcription; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; inflammation; lipid oxidation; macrophage; molecular biology; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; regulatory mechanism; RNA sequence; upregulation; vascular endothelial cell; animal; atherosclerosis; gene expression; genetics; male; metabolism; Animals; Atherosclerosis; Gene Expression; Humans; Hydroxycholesterols; Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors; Liver X Receptors; Male; Mice,2-s2.0-85030793192

We establish biomarkers that can discriminate between ALS patients and healthy controls. A principal component analysis (PCA) based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) is used to find gene biomarkers of ALS based on microarray gene expression data. Based on this method, 101 probes were selected as biomarkers for ALS with 95% high accuracy to discriminate between ALS patients and controls. Most of the genes corresponding to these probes are shown to be related to various cancers.

Ninety-three HCC patients and 108 non-HCC patients were enrolled for HBV genome-wide next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. A systematic literature review and a meta-analysis were performed to validate NGS-defined HCC-associated SNVs and deletions. The experimental results identified 60 NGS-defined HCC-associated SNVs, including 41 novel SNVs, and their pathogenic frequencies. Each SNV was specific for either genotype B (n = 24) or genotype C (n = 34), except for nt53C, which was present in both genotypes. The pathogenic frequencies of these HCC-associated SNVs showed a distinct U-shaped distribution pattern. According to the meta-analysis and literature review, 167 HBV variants from 109 publications were categorized into four levels (A–D) of supporting evidence that they are associated with HCC. The proportion of NGS-defined HCC-associated SNVs among these HBV variants declined significantly from 75% of 12 HCC-associated variants by meta-analysis (Level A) to 0% of 10 HCC-unassociated variants by meta-analysis (Level D) (P < 0.0001). PreS deletions were significantly associated with HCC, in terms of deletion index, for both genotypes B (P = 0.030) and C (P = 0.049). For genotype C, preS deletions involving a specific fragment (nt2977–3013) were significantly associated with HCC (HCC versus non-HCC, 6/34 versus 0/32, P = 0.025). Meta-analysis of preS deletions showed significant association with HCC (summary odds ratio 3.0; 95% confidence interval 2.3–3.9). Transfection of Huh7 cells showed that all of the five novel NGS-defined HCC-associated SNVs in the small surface region influenced hepatocarcinogenesis pathways, including endoplasmic reticulum-stress and DNA repair systems, as shown by microarray, real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis.

This study was aimed to test whether dynamic factors and Cai handling play roles in arrhythmogenesis of a diabetic animal model. Methods: We used 26 db/db type 2 diabetes mice and 28 control mice in this study. VA inducibility was evaluated in vivo under isoflurane general anesthesia. The intracellular Ca2+ (Cai) and membrane voltage (Vm) signals of the Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts were simultaneously recorded using the optical mapping technique. Action potential duration (APD), Cai dynamics conduction velocity (CV), and arrhythmogenic alternans were analyzed. Western blot was conducted to examine expressions of calcium handling and associated ion channels proteins. Results: The diabetic db/db mice showed significantly increased VA inducibility and severity. Longer APD and Cai transient duration and slower Cai decay and CV in the db/db mice than these in the control ones were observed. Dynamic pacing showed increased incidence of spatially discordant alternans leading to more VA inducibility in the db/db mice. Western blot analyses revealed increased phosphorylated-Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II protein expression and decreased ryanodine receptor protein expression, which probably underlay the molecular mechanisms of enhanced arrhythmogenicity in db/db mice. Conclusions: The type 2 diabetic mouse hearts show impaired repolarization, Cai handling homeostasis, and cardiac conduction reserve, leading to vulnerability of spatially discordant alternans development and induction of VA. Altered Cai-handling protein expressions probably underlie the molecular mechanisms of arrhythmogenicity in the type 2 diabetes animal model. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",arrhythmia; conduction velocity; db/db mouse; intracellular calcium dynamics; type 2 diabetes,"calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase II; calcium ion; ion channel; ryanodine receptor; calcium; action potential duration; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; arrhythmogenesis; Article; calcium cell level; calcium homeostasis; controlled study; db/db mouse; disease association; disease severity; enzyme phosphorylation; female; heart muscle conduction disturbance; heart muscle fiber membrane potential; heart repolarization; heart ventricle arrhythmia; in vivo study; isolated heart; male; molecular pathology; mouse; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; protein expression; sinus node conduction velocity; Western blotting; animal; disease model; electrophysiology; experimental diabetes mellitus; heart arrhythmia; intracellular space; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; physiology; Animals; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Calcium; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Disease Models, Animal; Electrophysiological Phenomena; Intracellular Space; Mice",2-s2.0-85029493389

Among the methods for detecting deletions from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, few methods considered the characteristics of virus, such as high evolution rates and high divergence among the different HBV genomes. Sequencing high divergence HBV genome sequences using the NGS technology outputs millions of reads. Thus, detecting exact breakpoints of deletions from these big and complex data incurs very high computational cost. We proposed a novel analytical method named VirDelect (Virus Deletion Detect), which uses split read alignment base to detect exact breakpoint and diversity variable to consider high divergence in single-end reads data, such that the computational cost can be reduced without losing accuracy. We use four simulated reads datasets and two real pair-end reads datasets of HBV genome sequence to verify VirDelect accuracy by score functions. The experimental results show that VirDelect outperforms the state-of-the-art method Pindel in terms of accuracy score for all simulated datasets and VirDelect had only two base errors even in real datasets. VirDelect is also shown to deliver high accuracy in analyzing the single-end read data as well as pair-end data. VirDelect can serve as an effective and efficient bioinformatics tool for physiologists with high accuracy and efficient performance and applicable to further analysis with characteristics similar to HBV on genome length and high divergence.

The obstacle avoidance controller actively controls the velocity to guide the user in a direction that avoids collisions. A shared-control scheme combines active obstacle avoidance and passive-compliant motion commands.

The interaction of Enterobius vermicularis infection in particular with gut microbiota and induced immune responses has never been thoroughly examined. Methodology/Findings: In order to answer the question of whether exposure to pinworm and mebendazole can shift the intestinal microbial composition and immune responses, we recruited 109 (30 pinworm-negative, 79 pinworm-infected) first and fourth grade primary school children in Taichung, Taiwan, for a gut microbiome study and an intestinal cytokine and SIgA analysis. In the pinworm-infected individuals, fecal samples were collected again at 2 weeks after administration of 100 mg mebendazole. Gut microbiota diversity increased after Enterobius infection, and it peaked after administration of mebendazole. At the phylum level, pinworm infection and mebendazole deworming were associated with a decreased relative abundance of Fusobacteria and an increased proportion of Actinobacteria. At the genus level, the relative abundance of the probiotic Bifidobacterium increased after enterobiasis and mebendazole treatment. The intestinal SIgA level was found to be lower in the pinworm-infected group, and was elevated in half of the mebendazole-treated group. A higher proportion of pre-treatment Salmonella spp. was associated with a non-increase in SIgA after mebendazole deworming treatment. Conclusions/Significance: Childhood exposure to pinworm plus mebendazole is associated with increased bacterial diversity, an increased abundance of Actinobacteria including the probiotic Bifidobacterium, and a decreased proportion of Fusobacteria. The gut SIgA level was lower in the pinworm-infected group, and was increased in half of the individuals after mebendazole deworming treatment. ? 2017 Yang et al.",,"interleukin 1beta; interleukin 4; mebendazole; RNA 16S; secretory immunoglobulin; cytokine; mebendazole; secretory immunoglobulin; Actinobacteria; Alistipes; Article; Bacteroidetes; Bifidobacterium; bioinformatics; Blautia; child; DNA extraction; enterobiasis; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; feces analysis; Firmicutes; Fusobacteria; gastroenteritis; gene sequence; genetic variability; human; immune response; intestine flora; major clinical study; metagenomics; microscopy; mixed infection; Proteobacteria; real time polymerase chain reaction; respiratory tract infection; Salmonella enterica; school child; staining; Streptococcus; animal; biology; biosynthesis; drug effects; enterobiasis; Enterobius; epidemiology; feces; female; genetics; growth, development and aging; immunity; immunology; intestine; intestine flora; isolation and purification; male; microbiology; parasitology; preschool child; Salmonella; Taiwan; Animals; Bifidobacterium; Child; Child, Preschool; Computational Biology; Cytokines; Enterobiasis; Enterobius; Feces; Female; Fusobacteria; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Immunity; Immunoglobulin A, Secretory; Intestines; Male; Mebendazole; Salmonella; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85030640482

In this study, the complexity of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals was explored in patients with depression using multiscale entropy (MSE). Thirty-five patients diagnosed with depression and 22 age-and gender-matched healthy controls were considered. The MSE profiles in five brain networks of the two participant groups were evaluated and analyzed. The results showed that depressive patients exhibited higher complexity in the left frontoparietal network than that seen in healthy controls, which is known to be critical for executive control functions. Through this study, the efficacy of MSE in identifying and understanding the mental disorders was also demonstrated. ? 2017 IEEE.",,brain; brain mapping; entropy; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; system analysis; Brain; Brain Mapping; Entropy; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Systems Analysis,2-s2.0-85032184001

Existing emergency vehicle dispatching systems rely heavily on manual assignments. Although some technology-assisted emergency systems engage in emergency message dissemination and path planning, efficient emergency response is one of the main factors that can decrease traffic-related deaths. Obviously, effective emergency response often plays a far more important role in a successful rescue. In this article, we propose a secure IoT-based and incentive-aware emergency personnel dispatching scheme (EPDS) with weighted fine-grained access control. Our EPDS can recruit available medical personnel on-the-fly, such as physicians driving in the vicinity of the accident scene. An appropriate incentive, such as paid leave, can be offered to encourage medical personnel to join rescue missions. Furthermore, IoT-based devices are installed in vehicles or wearable on drivers to gather biometric signals from the driver, which can be used to decide precisely which divisions or physicians are needed to administer the appropriate remedy. Additionally, our scheme can cryptographically authorize the assigned rescue vehicle to control traffic to increase rescue efficacy. Our scheme also takes advantage of adjacent roadside units to organize the appropriate rescue personnel without requiring long-distance communication with a trusted traffic authority. Proof of security is provided and extensive analyses, including qualitative and quantitative analyses and simulations, show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve rescue response time and effectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to make use of medical personnel that are close by in emergency rescue missions. ? 2017 ACM.",Biometric authentication; Emergency personnel dispatch; Fine-grained access control; Internet of vehicles; Security,Access control; Accidents; Biometrics; Highway accidents; Internet of things; Motion planning; Response time (computer systems); Vehicles; Biometric authentication; Emergency message disseminations; Emergency personnel dispatch; Fine grained; Long distance communication; Qualitative and quantitative analysis; Security; Traffic authorities; Emergency services,2-s2.0-85029819323

Periostin plays an important role in tumor development and is involved in carcinoma cell epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), whereby mature epithelial cells undergo phenotypic morphological changes and become invasive, motile cells. Here, we discuss the molecular mechanisms involved in periostin-induced promotion of EMT in lung cancer cells. Online TCGA datasets demonstrate the prognostic relevance of periostin in lung cancer; a higher periostin level correlates with poor overall survival. Similarly, our IHC results show that high periostin expression is positively correlated with the EMT markers Snail and Twist, as well as stage of lung cancer. We found that recombinant periostin induces the EMT phenotype in lung cancer cells through the p38/ERK pathway, while pretreatment with chemical inhibitors prevented periostin-induced EMT induction. Moreover, we found that periostin regulates EMT by repressing microRNA-381 (miR- 381) expression, which targets both Snail and Twist. Using the miR-381 mimic, we dramatically reversed periostin-induced Snail and Twist expression. Furthermore, periostin knockdown dramatically affected EMT markers and cell migration potential. The role of periostin in lung cancer progression is elucidated by the in vivo mouse model. Our findings indicate that changes in periostin expression in lung cancer may serve as a therapeutic target for the treatment of lung cancer metastasis.",Epithelial-mesenchymal transition; Lung cancer; MAPK; MiR-381; Periostin,microRNA; microRNA 381; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; recombinant protein; transcription factor RUNX2; transcription factor Snail; transcription factor Twist; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer growth; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer survival; cell migration; controlled study; correlational study; disease association; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene silencing; human; human cell; human tissue; in vivo study; lung cancer; lung cancer cell line; lung metastasis; major clinical study; male; MAPK signaling; mouse; nonhuman; overall survival; phenotype; protein database; protein expression,2-s2.0-85028768715

The technique of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) used to monitor the dorsal foot blood circulation condition is by measuring the absorption differences between oxy-hemoglobin and deoxy-hemoglobin. Study Designs/Materials and Methods: Patients with diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) treated in our wound care center were divided into two sub-groups based on the Duplex ultrasound or angiography. Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and non-peripheral arterial disease were divided into group A1 and A2, respectively. We applied wireless NIRS on patients’ dorsal foot to assess the peripheral circulation by continuously detect the signal penetrating the tissue while patients were asked to do Buerger's exercise. The same procedure was also repeated on 15 healthy participants as control group B. Results: From January to August 2015, 30 patients with DFU (Group A) were enrolled in the study, 9 patients in Group A1 and 21 patients in Group A2. Tissue concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) in each group varied in a similar trend among five stages of Buerger's exercise. HbO2 concentration increases at post-exercise stages in all groups (P = 0.006 in Group A1, P = 0.223 in Group A2, P = 0.03 in Group B), however, there were significant difference in both pre- and post-exercise stages (P = 0.001 and P = 0.01, respectively) between Group A and B. Moreover, significant differences (P = 0.0009) of HbO2 were also found between Group A1 and A2 in pre-exercise status, but no significant difference (P = 0.294) was found in post-exercise status. Similar results were also found in total hemoglobin (Hb) concentration analyses. Conclusions: Buerger's exercise could increase peripheral HbO2 and total Hb circulation in patients with diabetes foot ulcer. The NIRS could continuously and quantitatively monitor real-time peripheral circulation in postural changes and is novel to rehabilitation program. A larger scale study to prove the accuracy of NIRS system in detecting peripheral circulation could be worthwhile. Lasers Surg.

However, there was previously no integrated monitoring system available to simultaneously record both the real-time cardiopulmonary physiological parameters and the walking information (i.e., walking distance, speed, and acceleration) during the 6MWT. In this study, then, a wearable and wireless multi-parameter monitoring system was proposed to simultaneously monitor oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), heart rhythm, and the walking information during the 6MWT. A multi-parameter detection algorithm was also designed to estimate the heart rate effectively. The results of the study indicate that this system was able to reveal the dynamic changes and differences in walking speed and acceleration during the 6MWT. As such, the system has the potential to provide a more integrated approach to monitoring cardiopulmonary parameters and walking information simultaneously during the 6MWT.

Method Fruits were purchased from supermarkets and washed with buffer. The pellets were re-suspended in medium after centrifugation. The cell suspensions were plated onto CHROMagar Candida medium. Yeasts were identified by ribosomal DNA sequencing and their drug susceptibilities were determined by broth microdilution assay. Results Of 184 isolates, comprised of 55 species, from 22 different types of fruits, 29 species, including Candida famata, Candida fermentati, Candida guilliermondii, Candida intermedia, Candida krusei, Candida orthopsilosis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida pelliculosa, Candida tropicalis, and others have been reported to cause diseases in humans. In addition to C. krusei, intrinsically resistant to fluconazole, all Rhodotorula and Rhodosporidium species were resistant to fluconazole. One each of C. tropicalis isolate was belonged to diploid sequence type (DST)149 and DST225, genotypes also detected in isolates from humans. Furthermore, the DST225 isolate was less susceptible to azole drugs. The susceptibilities to azole drugs for clinical and agricultural usage were associated to each other.

One pathophysiological theory states that the brain–gut axis is responsible for pain control in the intestine. Although several studies have discussed the structural changes in the brain of IBS patients, most of these studies have been conducted in Western populations. Different cultures and sexes experience different pain sensations and have different pain responses. Accordingly, we aimed to identify the specific changes in the cortical thickness of Asian women with IBS and to compare these data to those of non-Asian women with IBS. Methods: Thirty Asian female IBS patients (IBS group) and 39 healthy individuals (control group) were included in this study. Brain structural magnetic resonance imaging was performed. We used FreeSurfer to analyze the differences in the cortical thickness and their correlations with patient characteristics. Results: The left cuneus, left rostral middle frontal cortex, left supramarginal cortex, right caudal anterior cingulate cortex, and bilateral insula exhibited cortical thinning in the IBS group compared with those in the controls. Furthermore, the brain cortical thickness correlated negatively the severity as well as duration of abdominal pain. Conclusions: Some of our findings differ from those of Western studies. In our study, all of the significant brain regions in the IBS group exhibited cortical thinning compared with those in the controls. The differences in cortical thickness between the IBS patients and controls may provide useful information to facilitate regulating abdominal pain in IBS patients. These findings offer insights into the association of different cultures and sexes with differences in cortical thinning in patients with IBS. ? 2017 Chua et al.

In this study, direct analysis in real time coupled to Q-orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry (DART-MS) was employed to detect a wide range of common organic pigments in vehicle paints. Twelve common organic pigments used in vehicle paints, such as red, yellow, orange, and purple, were tested, and a database was constructed for future examinations of vehicle paint. Two hit-and-run vehicle accident cases, which occurred in New Taipei City, were investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and DART-MS. First, FTIR spectroscopy was employed to study the paint samples as a preliminary screening step. Most of the observed IR peaks were attributed to binder and extenders present in paints. The IR peaks corresponding to the organic pigments were found to be weak and overlapped with those corresponding to resins. On the other hand, DART-MS successfully characterized the organic pigments.

We compared the performances of TGS and WES using the same DNA samples. Methods DNA was extracted from 10 endometrial tumor tissue specimens. Sequencing were performed with an Illumina HiSeq 2000. We randomly selected variants to confirm through Sanger sequencing or mutant-enriched PCR with Sanger sequencing. Results We found that the variants identified in both TGS and WES were true positives (47/47), regardless of the sequencing depth. Most variants found in TGS only were true positives (34/40), and most of the variants found by WES only were false positives (8/18). From these results, we suggest that the sequencing depth may not play important role in the accuracy of NGS-based methods. After analysis, we found that WES had a sensitivity of 72.70%, specificity of 96.27%, precision of 99.44%, and accuracy of 75.03%.

To study the crucial role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the regulation of tumor progression post-RT, microarray experiments comparing TAM gene expression profiles between unirradiated and irradiated tumors were conducted to discover possible roles of TAMs in initiation or contribution to tumor recurrence following RT, taking into account the relationships among gene expression, tumor microenvironment, and immunology. A single dose of 25?Gy was given to TRAMP C-1 prostate tumors established in C57/B6 mice. CD11b-positive macrophages were extracted from the tumors at one, two and three weeks post-RT. Gene ontology (GO) term analysis using the DAVID database revealed that genes that were differentially expressed at one and two weeks after irradiation were associated with biological processes such as morphogenesis of a branching structure, tube development, and cell proliferation. Analysis using Short Time-Series Expression Miner (STEM) revealed the temporal gene expression profiles and identified 13 significant patterns in four main groups of profiles. The genes in the upregulated temporal profile have diverse functions involved in the intracellular signaling cascade, cell proliferation, and cytokine-mediated signaling pathway. We show that tumor irradiation with a single 25-Gy dose can initiate a time-series of differentially expressed genes in TAMs, which are associated with the immune response, DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Our study helps to improve our understanding of the function of the group of genes whose expression changes temporally in an irradiated tumor microenvironment. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Microarray; Temporal gene expression; Tumor microenvironment; Tumor-associated macrophages,"Cell death; Cell proliferation; Cell signaling; Enzyme activity; Gene expression regulation; Genes; Irradiation; Macrophages; Microarrays; Patient treatment; Radiotherapy; Time series; Time series analysis; Tumors; Differentially expressed gene; Gene expression profiles; Gene expression profiling; Intracellular signaling; Mediated signaling pathways; Microarray experiments; Tumor associated macrophages; Tumor microenvironment; Gene expression; cytokine; animal; C57BL mouse; cell proliferation; gene expression profiling; genetics; macrophage; metabolism; mouse; neoplasm; pathology; radiation response; X ray; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Cytokines; Gene Expression Profiling; Macrophages; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neoplasms; X-Rays",2-s2.0-85019934189

However, whether this reduced lateralization exists at the early stage of SZ remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate language lateralization in first episode schizophrenia (FES) using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during a letter version of verbal fluency test (VFT). Methods A total of 28 FES patients and 33 healthy controls (HCs) underwent NIRS while performing a VFT. Six regions of interests (ROIs) were defined: the bilateral frontal-, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and temporal regions. Laterality index (LI) was calculated and compared between the two groups in ROIs. In addition, we investigated whether language lateralization was correlated with severity of clinical symptoms. Results Across all ROIs, LI was significantly reduced in FES patients (p = 0.037) compared to controls in the IFG region. In addition, LI was not found to be correlated with VFT performance, the PANSS positive, negative or general psychopathology subscales. Conclusions Our study demonstrated a diminution of leftward functional lateralization in the IFG during a VFT in FES patients.

However, whether reversibility exists in mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-derived hepatocytes (dHeps) remains elusive. In this study, we find that hepatogenic differentiation (HD) of MSCs is a reversible process and is modulated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). DNMTs are regulated by transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1), which in turn controls hepatogenic differentiation and de-differentiation. In addition, a stepwise reduction in TGFβ1 concentrations in culture media increases DNMT1 and decreases DNMT3 in primary hepatocytes (Heps) and confers Heps with multi-differentiation potentials similarly to MSCs. Hepatic lineage reversibility of MSCs and lineage conversion of Heps are regulated by DNMTs in response to TGFβ1. This previously unrecognized TGFβ1-DNMTs-MSC-HD axis may further increase the understanding the normal and pathological processes in the liver, as well as functions of MSCs after transplantation to treat liver diseases. ? 2017",de-differentiation; DNA methyltransferases; hepatocyte; lineage conversion; plasticity,"2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone; 4 (4 fluorophenyl) 2 (4 methylsulfinylphenyl) 5 (4 pyridyl)imidazole; anthra[1,9 cd]pyrazol 6(2h) one; azacitidine; DNA methyltransferase 1; DNA methyltransferase 3A; DNA methyltransferase 3B; n (2,3 dihydroxypropoxy) 3,4 difluoro 2 (2 fluoro 4 iodoanilino)benzamide; transcription factor Snail; transforming growth factor beta1; DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase; DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase 1; DNA methyltransferase; DNA methyltransferase 3A; transforming growth factor beta; animal cell; animal experiment; apoptosis; Article; bone mineralization; cell differentiation; cell lineage; cell migration; cell vacuole; controlled study; culture medium; genomic instability; hepatic progenitor cell; human; liver cell; liver function; mesenchymal stroma cell; microarray analysis; mouse; nerve cell plasticity; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; signal transduction; animal; cell culture; cell differentiation; cell lineage; cytology; liver; liver cell; mesenchymal stroma cell; metabolism; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Lineage; Cells, Cultured; DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1; DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases; DNA Modification Methylases; Hepatocytes; Humans; Liver; Mesenchymal Stromal Cells; Mice; Signal Transduction; Transforming Growth Factor beta",2-s2.0-85020303486

Methods In this nationwide population-based longitudinal study, data from 1998–2012 Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database were used. We used ICD9-CM codes 617.X and 642.X respectively for the diagnoses of endometriosis and GH-PE, which were further confirmed by examining medical records of surgeries, blood pressure and urine protein to ensure the accuracy of the diagnoses. The study excluded women diagnosed with endometriosis at < 15 or > 45 years of age, chronic hypertension, and GH-PE prior to endometriosis. Each pregnant woman with a prior diagnosis of endometriosis was matched to 4 pregnant women without endometriosis by age. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for the risk of GH-PE with adjustment for age, occupation, urbanization, economic status and comorbidities. Results Among 6,300 women with a prior endometriosis diagnosis who were retrieved from a population of 1,000,000 residents, 2,578 (40.92%) had subsequent pregnancies that were eligible for further analysis and were compared with 10,312 pregnant women without previous endometriosis. GH-PE occurred more in women with prior endometriosis as compared to those without endometriosis (3.88% vs. 1.63%, p<0.0001). Further analysis revealed prior endometriosis was associated with GH-PE (adjusted OR = 2.27; 95% CI:1.76–2.93). For danazol-treated and non-danazol-treated subgroups, the incidences of GH-PE were 3.13% (15/480) and 4.05% (85/2,098), respectively. Although the risk for subsequent GH-PE was lower (adjusted OR = 1.49; 95% CI:0.86–2.56) after receiving danazol treatment than average (adjusted OR = 2.27; 95% CI:1.76–2.93) for women with preceding endometriosis, the reduction of risk was not statistically remarkable for danazol-treated (adjusted OR = 1.49) vs. non-danazol-treated (adjusted OR = 2.48) subgroups (p heterogeneity = 0.12).

Materials and Methods: Six patients with prostate adenocarcinoma who underwent robotic prostatectomy with whole-mount preservation of the prostate were identified, which enabled spatial mapping between preoperative multiparametric MR imaging and the gland. Four regions of interest were identified within each gland, including regions found to be normal and abnormal via histopathologic analysis. Wholeexome DNA sequencing (>50 times coverage) was performed on each of these spatially targeted regions. Radiogenomic analysis of imaging and mutation data were performed with hierarchical clustering, phylogenetic analysis, and principal component analysis. Results: Radiogenomic multiparametric MR imaging and whole-exome spatial characterization in six patients with prostate adenocarcinoma (three patients, Gleason score of 3 + 4; and three patients, Gleason score of 4 + 5) was performed across 23 spatially distinct regions. Hierarchical clustering separated histopathologic analysis-proven high-grade lesions from the normal regions, and this reflected concordance between multiparametric MR imaging and resultant histopathologic analysis in all patients. Seventy-seven mutations involving 29 cancer-associated genes across the 23 spatially distinct prostate samples were identified. There was no significant difference in mutation load in cancer-associated genes between regions that were proven to be normal via histopathologic analysis (34 mutations per sample ± 19), mildly suspicious via multiparametric MR imaging (37 mutations per sample ± 21), intermediately suspicious via multiparametric MR imaging (31 mutations per sample ± 15), and high-grade cancer (33 mutations per sample ± 18) (P = .30). Principal component analysis resolved samples from different patients and further classified samples (regardless of histopathologic status) from prostate glands with Gleason score 3 + 4 versus 4 + 5 samples. Conclusion: Multiregion spatial multiparametric MR imaging and wholeexome radiogenomic analysis of prostate glands with adenocarcinoma shows a continuum of mutations across regions that were found via histologic analysis to be high grade and normal. ? 2017 RSNA.",,"adult; aged; Article; cancer grading; clinical article; cluster analysis; controlled study; disease association; DNA sequence; gene mutation; genetic variation; genomics; Gleason score; histopathology; human; human cell; human tissue; image analysis; male; multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging; mutational analysis; phylogeny; preoperative evaluation; principal component analysis; priority journal; prostate adenocarcinoma; prostatectomy; radiogenomics; robot assisted surgery; tumor microenvironment; whole exome sequencing; adenocarcinoma; diagnostic imaging; early cancer diagnosis; exome; genetic predisposition; genetics; genomics; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; prostate tumor; retrospective study; three dimensional imaging; tumor microenvironment; tumor marker; Adenocarcinoma; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Early Detection of Cancer; Exome; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genomics; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neoplasm Grading; Phylogeny; Prostatic Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Tumor Microenvironment",2-s2.0-85021115111

While sociologists have explored in-depth situations in which the social role of the sick is ambiguous, few studies have investigated body experiences under liminality that requires sick people to find a new sick role. Living with lingering symptoms in a post–Hansen’s disease world, the Hansen’s disease patients I have studied face the conundrum of having to find an alternative sick role. Ethnographic fieldwork demonstrates how patients develop a specific set of body techniques that shape and are shaped by their membership in a patient community. Exploring the reinforcing projects of re-embodiment and sociality around Hansen’s disease, I argue that patients are able both to legitimate each other’s feelings of sickness and to use those feelings to manage their illness and, as such, to collectively acquire an alternative sick role. Adding to existing discussions of active patients, this article identifies the body mechanical as a way of practicing active patienthood organized around fixing, trials, mending and functionality. ? 2016, ?

Objective The purpose of this study was to test the hypotheses that (1) increased SKNA is associated with the onset and termination of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (AT) and atrial fibrillation (AF) and (2) sinoatrial node response to SKNA is reduced in patients with more frequent AT or AF episodes. Methods SKNA and electrocardiogram were recorded in 11 patients (4 men and 7 women; average age 66 ± 10 years), including 3 patients with AT (11 ± 18 episodes per patient) and 8 patients with AF (24 ± 26 episodes per patient). Results The average SKNA (aSKNA) 10 seconds before AT onset was 1.07 ± 0.10 μV and 10 seconds after termination was 1.27 ± 0.10 μV; both were significantly (P =.032 and P <.0001) higher than that during sinus rhythm (0.97 ± 0.09 μV). The aSKNA 10 seconds before AF onset was 1.34 ± 0.07 μV and 10 seconds after termination was 1.31 ± 0.07 μV; both were significantly (P <.0001) higher than that during sinus rhythm (1.04 ± 0.07 μV). The aSKNA before onset (P <.0001) and after termination (P =.0011) was higher in AF than in AT. The sinus rate correlated (P <.0001) with aSKNA in each patient (average r = 0.74; 95% confidence interval 0.65–0.84). The r value in each patient negatively correlated with the number of AT and AF episodes (r = ?0.6493; 95% confidence interval ?0.8990 to ?0.08073; P =.0306). Conclusion Increased SKNA was observed both at the onset and termination of AT and AF.

Methods: This nationwide, population-based study is an inspection and review of data from the 1998 to 2012 Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. In a sample of 1,000,000 randomly sampled individuals, women with PCOS (exposure group; n = 7,049) and women without PCOS (contrast group; n = 70,490) were compared. Women initially diagnosed with PCOS at less than 15 or more than 35 years of age were excluded. Each woman with PCOS was age-matched to 10 women without PCOS. The diagnoses of PCOS and POI (coded using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification) were further confirmed with blood test results and ultrasonographic findings to ensure the accuracy of the diagnoses. Results: POI occurred more among women with PCOS compared with women without PCOS (3.73% vs 0.44%; P < 0.001). Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the POI-free survival rates were significantly different between the exposure and contrast groups (P < 0.001). During 10 years of follow-up, Cox proportional-hazard analysis revealed that the risk for POI was significantly higher in the exposure than in the contrast group (hazard ratio [HR] 8.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 7.33-10.18) and remained similar after adjustment for covariates (adjusted HR 8.31, 95% CI 7.05-9.81). Compared with that of women without PCOS, the risk of POI was even higher for women with PCOS who did not receive metformin treatment (adjusted HR 9.93, 95% CI 8.28-11.90). However, the risk for POI was significantly reduced for women with PCOS who received metformin treatment (adjusted HR 5.66, 95% CI 4.36-7.35). Conclusions: As a possible precursor stage, prior PCOS is a significant and independent risk factor for development of POI.

Furthermore, the combinational effects of tannins and anticancer drugs have been demonstrated in this review, including chemoprotective, chemosensitive, and antagonizing effects accompanying with anticancer effect. However, the applications of tannins have been hindered due to their poor liposolubility, low bioavailability, off-taste, and shorter half-life time in human body, such as EGCG, gallic acid, and ellagic acid. To tackle these obstacles, novel drug delivery systems have been employed to deliver tannins with the aim of improving their applications, such as gelatin nanoparticles, micelles, nanogold, liposomes, and so on.

The application of nsPEF induces a change both in intensity and lifetime of NADH, indicating that the intracellular function is affected by application of nsPEF in both normal and cancer cells. The application of nsPEF induces an increase in the fluorescence lifetime of NADH and a morphological change, which is attributed to the induction of apoptosis by nsPEF.

It is also found that apoptosis can be induced only in cancer cells using a suitable nsPEF, showing a possibility that ultrashort pulsed electric field is applicable for drug-free cancer therapy. ? 2017 American Chemical Society.",,,2-s2.0-85028950764

Both therapeutic target identification and proof-of-concept experimentation in anti-cancer drug development require appropriate animal models, such as xenograft tumor transplantation in transgenic and knockout mice. In the progression of cancer metastasis, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are the most critical factor in determining the prognosis of cancer patients. Several studies have demonstrated that measuring CTC-specific markers in a clinical setting (e.g., flow cytometry) can provide a current status of cancer development in patients. However, this useful technique has rarely been applied in the real-time monitoring of CTCs in preclinical animal models. Methods: In this study, we designed a rapid and reliable detection method by combining a bioluminescent in vivo imaging system (IVIS) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR)-based analysis to measure CTCs in animal blood. Using the IVIS Spectrum CT System with 3D-imaging on orthotropic-developed breast-tumor-bearing mice. Results: In this manuscript, we established a quick and reliable method for measuring CTCs in a preclinical animal mode. The key to this technique is the use of specific human and mouse GUS primers on DNA/RNA of mouse peripheral blood under an absolute qPCR system. First, the high sensitivity of cancer cell detection on IVIS was presented by measuring the luciferase carried MDA-MB-231 cells from 5 to 5x1011 cell numbers with great correlation (R2 = 0.999). Next, the MDA-MB-231 cell numbers injected by tail vein and their IVIS radiance signals were strongly corrected with qPCR-calculated copy numbers (R2 &gt; 0.99). Furthermore, by applying an orthotropic implantation animal model, we successfully distinguished xenograft tumor-bearing mice and control mice with a significant difference (p &lt; 0.001), whereas IVIS Spectrum-CT 3D-visualization showed that blood of mice with lung metastasis contained more than twice the CTC numbers than ordinary tumor-bearing mice. We demonstrated a positive correlation between lung metastasis status and CTC numbers in peripheral mouse blood. Conclusion: Collectively, the techniques developed for this study resulted in the integration of CTC assessments into preclinical models both in vivo and ex vivo, which will facilitate translational targeted therapy in clinical practice. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Cancer metastasis; Circulating tumor cells; In vivo bioluminescent imaging system; Quantitative PCR,"primer DNA; primer RNA; tumor marker; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; breast tumor; cancer diagnosis; circulating tumor cell; controlled study; female; gene dosage; human; human cell; imaging system; in vivo imaging system; lung metastasis; MDA-MB-231 cell line; mouse; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; quantitative analysis; quantitative polymerase chain reaction; tumor xenograft; animal; blood; diagnostic imaging; disease model; drug screening; flow cytometry; genetics; metastasis; molecular imaging; pathology; procedures; prognosis; tumor embolism; Animals; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Mice; Molecular Imaging; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplastic Cells, Circulating; Prognosis; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-85021252046

With almost all radiative recombinations occurring through oxide-related defect states located on the SiQD surface, the SiQD-NPs have very long photoluminescence lifetimes of about 25 μs, in contrast to the nanosecond-range lifetimes of other commonly used biological fluorophores. This drastic lifetime difference enables a time-gated imaging method here, in which the time-resolved photon distribution of each pixel of a fluorescence image is measured by using a time-correlated single-photon counting technique. Then, by integrating the photon histogram of each pixel over respective time windows, the long-lived component of the fluorescence image comprising only the fluorescence emitted from the SiQD-NPs is separated from all other short-lived signals resulting from the organic dyes and the cell endogenous luminescence. For instance, the membrane and nucleus of a single cancer cell or two types of cancer cells, immunostained with the SiQD-NPs and the organic dyes, respectively, can be clearly distinguished from each other by time-gating, which otherwise cannot be accomplished by conventional multiplexing due to spectral overlap in the wavelength domain. ? 2017 American Chemical Society.",bioconjugation; biological labels; immunofluorescence; silicon quantum dots; time-gated imaging,Chemical detection; Cytology; Diseases; Fluorescence; Nanocrystals; Nanoparticles; Photons; Pixels; Semiconductor quantum dots; Silicon; Stripping (dyes); Surface defects; Bio-conjugation; Biological labels; immunofluorescence; Silicon quantum dots; Time-gated imaging; Cells,2-s2.0-85021139966

Thus, the current longitudinal study determined the role of IDA as a risk factor for osteoporosis by analyzing a large nationwide population-based sample. In a sample of 1, 000, 000 randomly sampled individuals from the 1998-2012. Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, patients with IDA (case group (n = 35, 751)) and individuals without IDA (control group (n = 178, 755)) were compared. Patients who were <20 years of age and who had pre-existing osteoporosis prior to the diagnosis of IDA were excluded. Each patient with IDA was age-and gender-matched to five individuals without IDA. The diagnoses of IDA and osteoporosis (coded using ICD-9CM) were further confirmed with blood test results and X-ray bone densitometry to ensure the accuracy of the diagnoses. Osteoporosis occurred more often among patients with IDA compared to individuals without IDA (2.27% vs. 1.32%, p < 0.001). Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed that the risk for osteoporosis was significantly higher in the case than the control group (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.61-1.88) and remained similar after adjustment for covariates (adjusted HR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.67-1.97). Compared with individuals without IDA, the risk for osteoporosis was even higher for patients with IDA who received intravenous ferrum therapy (adjusted HR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.85-2.63). In contrast, the risk for osteoporosis was reduced for patients with IDA who received a blood transfusion (adjusted HR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.20-1.80). As a predictor, prior IDA is a significant and independent risk factor for development of osteoporosis. ? 2017 by the authors.

In experiments about call block probabilities (CBP), this study simulated two cases that are the situations of the whole day and traffic accident. The simulation results show that all CBPs in the scenario of whole day are less than 21.5% by using the proposed mechanism, which is better than using the static channel allocation (SCA) mechanism. Moreover, all CBPs in the scenario of traffic accidents are less than 16.5% by using the proposed mechanism, which is better than using the SCA mechanism. Therefore, the proposed mechanism can decrease the number of CBPs effectively. ? 2017 by the authors.

The objective of such trials is to accelerate the development process for a drug and shorten the drug’s approval time in key markets. Several statistical methods have been purposed for the design and evaluation of MRCTs, as well as for assessing the consistency of treatment effects across all regions with one primary endpoint. However, in some therapeutic areas (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease), the clinical efficacy of a new treatment may be characterized by a set of possibly correlated endpoints, known as multiple co-primary endpoints. In this paper, we focus on a specific region and establish three statistical criteria for evaluating consistency between the specific region and overall results in MRCTs with multiple co-primary endpoints. More specifically, two of those criteria are used to assess whether the treatment effect in the region of interest is as large as that of the other regions or of the regions overall, while the other criterion is used to assess the consistency of the treatment effect of the specific region achieving a pre-specified threshold. The sample size required for the region of interest can also be evaluated based on these three criteria. ? 2017 Huang et al.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the development and initial validation of a portable brain-computer interface (BCI) for objectively assessing visual function loss. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case-control study involved 62 eyes of 33 patients with glaucoma and 30 eyes of 17 healthy participants. Glaucoma was diagnosed based on a masked grading of optic disc stereophotographs. All participants underwent testing with a BCI device and standard automated perimetry (SAP) within3 months. The BCI device integrates wearable, wireless, dry electroencephalogram and electrooculogram systems and a cellphone-based head-mounted display to enable the detection of multifocal steady state visual-evoked potentials associated with visual field stimulation. The performances of global and sectoral multifocal steady state visual-evoked potentials metrics to discriminate glaucomatous from healthy eyes were compared with global and sectoral SAP parameters. The repeatability of the BCI device measurements was assessed by collecting results of repeated testing in 20 eyes of 10 participants with glaucoma for 3 sessions of measurements separated by weekly intervals. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Receiver operating characteristic curves summarizing diagnostic accuracy. Intraclass correlation coefficients and coefficients of variation for assessing repeatability. RESULTS: Among the33 participants with glaucoma, 19 (58%) were white, 12 (36%) were black, and 2 (6%) were Asian, while among the 17 participants with healthy eyes, 9 (53%) were white, 8 (47%) were black, and none were Asian. The receiver operating characteristic curve area for the global BCI multifocal steady state visual-evoked potentials parameter was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.86-0.96), which was larger than for SAP mean deviation (area under the curve, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72-0.90), SAP mean sensitivity (area under the curve, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69-0.88; P =.03), and SAP pattern standard deviation (area under the curve, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66-0.87; P =.01). No statistically significant differences were seen for the sectoral measurements between the BCI and SAP. Intraclass coefficients for global and sectoral parameters ranged from 0.74 to 0.92, and mean coefficients of variation ranged from 3.03% to 7.45%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The BCI device may be useful for assessing the electrical brain responses associated with visual field stimulation. The device discriminated eyes with glaucomatous neuropathy from healthy eyes in a clinically based setting. Further studies should investigate the feasibility of the BCI device for home-based testing as well as for detecting visual function loss over time. ? 2017 American Medical Association.

Psychiatric disorder in childhood is an important disease and easily neglected. There are several similarities in scabies and psychiatric disorders in childhood (PDC). Both of them may present with pruritus. They are relatively common in patients with lower socioeconomic status and crowded environment. Furthermore, immune-mediated inflammatory processes play a role in the pathophysiology in both diseases. An association between scabies and psychiatric disorders may exist. This nationwide population-based cohort study utilized data from the National Health Insurance Research Database to investigate the relationship between scabies and PDC. A total of 2137 children with scabies were identified as the study group and 8548 age- and sex-matched children were selected as the control group. A total of 607 (5.68%) children developed PDC during the 7-year follow-up period. The overall incidences of PDC are similar but patients with scabies had a higher risk of developing intellectual disability (ID) (scabies group vs control group: 1.3% vs 0.6%, adjusted hazard ratio: 2.04 and 95% confidence interval: 1.25-3.32). The immune-mediated inflammatory processes of both diseases were reviewed and may contribute to the 104% increased risk of interleukin in patients with scabies. We suggest a more comprehensive management in treating patients with scabies or ID. Early and comprehensive treatment of scabies and other risk factors may decrease the risk of subsequent ID. When we approach patients with ID, concurrent evaluation of scabies and other risk factors may contribute to successful management. ? 2017 the Author(s).",childhood psychiatric disorder; children; intellectual disability; mental disorder; mental health; National Health Insurance Research Database; scabies,"C reactive protein; gamma interferon; hydrocortisone; interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent; interleukin 10; interleukin 17; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 2; interleukin 4; interleukin 5; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor; adolescent; adult; Article; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; female; follow up; human; immune system; incidence; infant; inflammation; intellectual impairment; major clinical study; male; newborn; nonhuman; pathophysiology; priority journal; pruritus; risk factor; Sarcoptes scabiei; Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis; scabies; social status; animal; comorbidity; complication; factual database; immunology; Intellectual Disability; preschool child; proportional hazards model; public health; risk; scabies; Taiwan; Adolescent; Animals; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Databases, Factual; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Intellectual Disability; Male; National Health Programs; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk; Sarcoptes scabiei; Scabies; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85020447308

This study investigates the relationship between the severity of renal disease and cataract in a nationwide sample from Taiwan. Methods: The cohort from 1-million National Health Insurance beneficiaries from Taiwan was retrospectively analyzed. All adult beneficiaries were followed from January 1, 2005 until December 31, 2013, to identify patients who underwent cataract surgeries. On the basis of the ambulatory care records, those diagnosed with CKD (ICD-9-CM code: 585) during the follow-up period were enrolled as CKD patients after careful evaluation. Each patient with CKD was age- A nd gender-matched with 4 individuals who did not have CKD. Cox regression models were applied to compare the hazard of cataract surgery in individuals with and without CKD. Subgroup analysis was used to compare patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with age- A nd gender-matched non-CKD individuals. ESRD was defined by CKD patients who need regular renal replacement therapy. The same method was applied to evaluate hazard ratios (HRs). Results: After age and gender matching, there were 11,881 patients in the CKD group and 47,524 in the non-CKD group. After control for possible confounding, the adjusted HR (aHR) of cataract was 1.84 (95% CI 1.73-1.95) for the CKD group. Subgroup analysis of patients with ESRD (n = 3,209) and non-CKD individuals (n = 12,836), with matching done on the basis of age and gender, indicated an aHR of cataract was 2.33 (95% CI 2.10-2.59) for the ESRD group. Conclusions: This study indicates a relationship between CKD and cataract, and suggests that the risk for cataract increases with the severity of renal impairment. ? 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel.

However, it remains unknown whether this risk also prevails with the use of other types of antidepressants. The aim of this study was to investigate whether use of antidepressants is associated with an increased risk of cataract development. Moreover, the relationship between binding affinities of serotonin transporter (SERT) of antidepressant and the risk of cataracts is examined. Methods We conducted a nested case-control study using National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. A total of 14,288 patients were included; 7651 in the cataract group and 6637 in the control group. Antidepressant exposure was categorized by type, duration of use, and binding affinities of SERT. The association between antidepressant exposure and cataract development was assessed using conditional logistic regression analysis. Results The adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for developing cataracts among continuous users of SSRIs, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and other antidepressants were 1.26 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12–1.41, p<0.001), 1.21 (95% CI: 1.02–1.43, p=0.027), and 1.18 (95% CI: 1.04–1.34, p=0.009) respectively. Specifically, continuous uses of fluoxetine (AOR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.01–1.46, p=0.042), fluvoxamine (AOR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.01–2.12, p=0.043), venlafaxine (AOR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.19–1.74, p<0.001) significantly increased the risk of cataract development. Moreover, continuous users of antidepressants with intermediate SERT binding affinities (AOR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.10–2.56, p=0.017) were significantly associated with increased risks of cataract development. Limitations Several confounding factors such as obesity, multiple drug users, family history of cataracts, substance use, and environmental factors (such as sunlight or radiation exposure) were acquired.

Interleukin (IL)-28 and IL-29 are relatively newly discovered cytokines and play an important role in our immune defense against pathogens, especially for viral infection. In the present study, we investigated serum IL-28 and IL-29 expression and the relationship to clinical and laboratory parameters in patients with dengue virus infection. Adult patients with dengue (n = 45) and control group (n = 24) were included prospectively. Clinical symptoms and laboratory data were collected from every patient. We investigated IL-28 and IL-29 levels in serum by ELISA. The concentrations of serum IL-28 and IL-29 were significantly higher in subjects with dengue when compared to those of control group. The patients with higher serum IL-28 and IL-29 levels had significantly lower ALAT and peripheral blood neutrophil percentage, but higher peripheral platelet, total white blood cell (WBC), monocyte, and lymphocyte counts. Patients with higher serum IL-28 and IL-29 levels also had more flu-like symptoms, but less vomiting. Increased level of IL-28 and IL-29 was associated with better liver function, platelet and WBC numbers and clinical symptom in subjects with dengue and could potentially serve as a protective marker. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Dengue fever; IL-28; IL-29; Interferon,"interleukin 28; interleukin 29; biological marker; IL28A protein, human; IL29 protein, human; interleukin derivative; Article; dengue; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; human; priority journal; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; thrombocyte count; virus isolation; adolescent; adult; aged; blood; chemistry; dengue; female; immunology; male; middle aged; pathology; prospective study; serum; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers; Dengue; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Humans; Interleukins; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Serum; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85013780446

However, extant research on the visual association of designers and the differences between expert and novice designers when they engage in the visual association task are scant. Using electroencephalography (EEG), this study attempted to narrow this research gap. Sixteen healthy designers—eight experts and eight novices—were recruited, and asked to perform visual association while EEG signals were acquired, subsequently analysed using independent component analysis. The results indicated that strong connectivity was observed among the prefrontal, frontal, and cingulate cortices, and the default mode network. The experts used both hemispheres and executive functions to support their association tasks, whereas the novices mainly used their right hemisphere and memory retrieval functions. The visual association of experts appeared to be more goal-directed than that of the novices. Accordingly, designing and implementing authentic and goal-directed activities for improving the executive functions of the prefrontal cortex and default mode network are critical for design educators and creativity researchers. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",EEG; Electroencephalography; Expert designer; Novice designer; Visual association,Electrophysiology; Independent component analysis; Default-mode networks; Executive function; Expert and novices; Expert designer; Novice designers; Prefrontal cortex; Right hemispheres; Strong connectivity; Electroencephalography; adult; Article; association cortex; cingulate gyrus; controlled study; creativity; default mode network; electroencephalography; executive function; female; frontal cortex; functional connectivity; human; human experiment; independent component analysis; information retrieval; male; memory; normal human; prefrontal cortex; right hemisphere; signal detection; state dependent learning; stimulus response; task performance; visual stimulation,2-s2.0-85012273719

However, very few people really understand their sleeping habits, which affect sleep-related diseases such as sleep apnea, back problems or even snoring. Most current techniques that monitor, predict and quantify sleep postures are limited to use in hospitals and/or need the intervention of caregivers. In this paper, we describe a system to automatically monitor, predict and quantify sleep postures that may be self-applied by the general public even in a non-hospital environment such as at a persons home. A Random Forest approach is adopted during training to predict and quantify sleep postures. After going through training procedures, a person needs only one sensor placed on the wrist to recognize the persons sleep postures. Our preliminary experiments using a set of testing data show about 90 percent accuracy, indicating that this design has a promising future to accurately analyze, predict and quantify human sleep postures. ? 2017 IEEE.",accelerometer; body sensor network; sleep posture; stream data,Accelerometers; Body sensor networks; Decision trees; Forecasting; Hospitals; Optical communication; Wearable sensors; Automatic labelling; General publics; Hospital environment; Random forests; sleep posture; Stream data; Testing data; Training procedures; Sleep research,2-s2.0-85021407268

The studies showed that 4-MB exhibits a dual ratiometric and calorimetric response toward peroxynitrite due to ONOO?-triggered oxidative reaction. A possible mechanism of the oxidation reaction was proposed and the reaction product was isolated and characterized using different spectroscopic methods. We have thoroughly demonstrated the utility of 4-MB for intracellular peroxynitrite imaging.

To assist these hearing-impaired elderly, we propose VisualLink, a visual aids system for them to better receive and comprehend a call. Specifically, VisualLink notifies elderly of a call using notifications on large screen (TV) and wearable device with haptic feedback. The elderly then pick up the call via a VisualLink phone with a traditional-look, which automatically uses speech recognition to transcribe the call and show the caption on the screen, with interactive visual content such as images authored by the caller. In the evaluation of the prototype, participants gave VisualLink positive feedback for its ease of use and usefulness for making them better connected to their family's life.

In this paper, we extend the work and propose a supervised classification algorithm for binaural speech enhancement/separation and dereverberation using a modified ideal binary mask (mIBM) as the training target and simple neural networks (NNs) as classifiers. The low complexity of the simple NNs makes the proposed algorithm practical for binaural hearing AIDS. The interaural time difference (ITD) and the interaural level difference (ILD) of each T-F unit are extracted as the basic binaural features. For the purpose of dereverberation, the interaural coherence (IC) is also considered when building the target mIBM and training the NNs. For separation evaluations, our method yields comparable performance to a more complicated benchmark system, which cannot de-reverb the signal.

This information is vitally important in Taiwan, where endometrial cancer is the second most common gynecological cancer. We performed whole-exome sequencing on DNA from 14 tumor tissue samples from Taiwanese endometrial cancer patients. We used the Genome Analysis Tool kit software package for data analysis, and the dbSNP, Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases for comparisons. Variants were validated via Sanger sequencing. We identified 143 non-synonymous mutations in 756 canonical cancer-related genes and 1,271 non-synonymous mutations in non-canonical cancer-related genes in 14 endometrial samples. PTEN, KRAS and PIK3R1 were the most frequently mutated canonical cancer-related genes.

Among different three-dimensional (3-D) imaging methods, integral imaging is a promising multiperspective sensing and display technique. Compared with other 3-D imaging techniques, integral imaging can capture a scene using an incoherent light source and generate real 3-D images for observation without any special viewing devices. This review paper describes passive multidimensional imaging systems combined with different integral imaging configurations. One example is the integral-imaging-based multidimensional optical sensing and imaging systems (MOSIS), which can be used for 3-D visualization, seeing through obscurations, material inspection, and object recognition from microscales to long range imaging. This system utilizes many degrees of freedom such as time and space multiplexing, depth information, polarimetric, temporal, photon flux and multispectral information based on integral imaging to record and reconstruct the multidimensionally integrated scene. Image fusion may be used to integrate the multidimensional images obtained by polarimetric sensors, multispectral cameras, and various multiplexing techniques. The multidimensional images contain substantially more information compared with two-dimensional (2-D) images or conventional 3-D images. In addition, we present recent progress and applications of 3-D integral imaging including human gesture recognition in the time domain, depth estimation, mid-wave-infrared photon counting, 3-D polarimetric imaging for object shape and material identification, dynamic integral imaging implemented with liquid-crystal devices, and 3-D endoscopy for healthcare applications. ? 2017 IEEE.",3-D endoscopy; 3-D human activity recognition; 3-D imaging; dynamic integral imaging; long-range integral imaging; material analysis; multidimensional object recognition; multispectral imaging; photon counting; polarimetric imaging,Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Image fusion; Imaging systems; Imaging techniques; Infrared radiation; Light sources; Liquid crystal displays; Liquid crystals; Medical imaging; Medical information systems; Multiplexing; Object recognition; Photons; Polarimeters; Three dimensional computer graphics; Time domain analysis; Visualization; Human gesture recognition; Material identification; Mid wave infrared (MWIR); Multi-dimensional images; Multiplexing techniques; Three dimensional (3-D) imaging; Two-dimensional (2D) images; Visualization technologies; Image processing,2-s2.0-85014820404

Herein, a novel supramolecular oligomer cytosine (Cy)-polypropylene glycol containing self-complementary multiple hydrogen-bonded Cy moieties is developed, which undergoes spontaneous self-assembly to form nanosized particles in an aqueous environment. Phase transitions and scattering studies confirm that the supramolecular nanogels can be readily tailored to obtain the desired phase-transition temperature and temperature-induced release of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). The resulting nanogels exhibit an extremely high load carrying capacity (up to 24.8%) and drug-entrapment stability, making the loading processes highly efficient. Importantly, in vitro cytotoxicity assays indicate that DOX-loaded nanogels possess excellent biosafety for drug delivery applications under physiological conditions. When the environmental temperature is increased to 40 °C, DOX-loaded nanogels trigger rapid DOX release and exert cytotoxic effects, significantly reducing the dose required compared to free DOX. Given its simplicity, low cost, high reliability, and efficiency, this newly developed temperature-responsive nanocarrier has highly promising potential for controlled release drug delivery systems.

The flexible photocurrent sensing system was manufactured on a 30-?m-thick crystalline silicon chip by chemical etching process, which produced a flexible silicon chip. A surface texturization design on the flexible device enhanced the light-trapping effect and minimized reflectivity losses from the incident light. The model protein streptavidin bound to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was successfully immobilized onto the sensor surface through high-affinity conjugation with biotin. The luminescence reaction occurred with luminol, hydrogen peroxide and HRP enzyme, and the emission of light from the catalytic reaction was detected by underlying flexible photodetector. The chemiluminescence in the miniaturized photocurrent sensing system was successfully used to determine the hydrogen peroxide concentration in real-time analyses. The hydrogen peroxide detection limit of the flexible MSM photodetector was 2.47?mM. The performance of the flexible MSM photodetector maintained high stability under bending at various bending radii. Moreover, for concave bending, a significant improvement in detection signal intensity (14.5% enhancement compared with a flat configuration) was observed because of the increased photocurrent, which was attributed to enhancement of light trapping. Additionally, this detector was used to detect hydrogen peroxide concentrations in commercial hair dye products, which is a significant issue in the healthcare field. The development of this novel, flexible and miniaturized MSM biomolecular photodetector with excellent mechanical flexibility and high sensitivity demonstrates the applicability of this approach to future wearable sensor development efforts. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Chemiluminescence; Flexible; Hair dye sensor; Hydrogen peroxide; MSM photodetector,Catalysis; Chemiluminescence; Hydrogen; Hydrogen peroxide; Light; Oxidation; Peroxides; Photocurrents; Photons; Proteins; Wearable sensors; Chemical-etching process; Flexible; Flexible photodetectors; Hydrogen peroxide concentration; Hydrogen peroxide detections; Hydrogen peroxide sensing; Metal semiconductor metal; MSM photodetector; Photodetectors; biotin; hair dye; horseradish peroxidase; hydrogen peroxide; luminol; silicon; streptavidin; hair dye; analytical equipment; Article; biochip; biomolecular electronics; catalysis; chemical etching; chemical reaction; chemoluminescence; concentration (parameters); conjugation; enzymic biosensor; light; limit of detection; luminescence; metal semiconductor metal; miniaturization; molecular stability; photodetector; semiconductor; signal detection; surface property; chemistry; genetic procedures; human; isolation and purification; luminescence; semiconductor; Biosensing Techniques; Hair Dyes; Horseradish Peroxidase; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Luminescence; Luminol; Semiconductors,2-s2.0-85002681908

In this report, biocompatible electron donor–acceptor conjugated semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (PPor-PEG NPs) with light-harvesting unit is prepared and developed for highly effective photoacoustic imaging guided photothermal therapy. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the concept of light-harvesting unit is exploited for enhancing the photoacoustic signal and photothermal energy conversion in polymer-based theranostic agent. Combined with additional merits including donor–acceptor pair to favor electron transfer and fluorescence quenching effect after NP formation, the photothermal conversion efficiency of the PPor-PEG NPs is determined to be 62.3%, which is the highest value among reported polymer NPs. Moreover, the as-prepared PPor-PEG NP not only exhibits a remarkable cell-killing ability but also achieves 100% tumor elimination, demonstrating its excellent photothermal therapeutic efficacy. Finally, the as-prepared water-dispersible PPor-PEG NPs show good biocompatibility and biosafety, making them a promising candidate for future clinical applications in cancer theranostics. ? 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The patent statue holds that a multi-step method patent is not directly infringed unless all steps are carried out and attributed to a single entity. When separate steps are performed jointly by two or more parties, those parties are liable for divided infringement if there exists a direct infringement. Possibilities thus exist for unauthorized but non-infringing joint performance, i.e. enforcing a method patent will be difficult if joint performance stands as a valid defense against direct infringement. Areas covered: This analysis covers issues on patent infringement, specifically on divided infringement of diagnostic and method patents. Expert opinion: A retrospective analysis indicates that a large number of cancer diagnostic patents issued during 2005-2014 are potentially vulnerable to read on unauthorized use in the manner of joint performance. Inventors should draft patent claims appropriately to reduce the risk to assert their patents in this regard. ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Cancer; diagnostic patents; divided infringement; method patents; patent infringement,administrative claims (health care); Article; cancer diagnosis; human; malignant neoplasm; patent; retrospective study; biotechnology; diagnostic procedure; inventor; legislation and jurisprudence; Neoplasms; patent; procedures; Biotechnology; Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures; Humans; Inventors; Neoplasms; Patents as Topic; Retrospective Studies,2-s2.0-85015244459

To improve the cancer screening procedure, we developed a portable light-emitting-diode (LED)-induced autofluorescence (LIAF) imager that contains two wavelength LED excitation light sources and multiple filters to capture ex vivo oral tissue autofluorescence images. Compared with conventional means of oral cancer diagnosis, the LIAF imager is a handier, faster, and more highly reliable solution. The compact design with a tiny probe allows clinicians to easily observe autofluorescence images of hidden areas located in concave deep oral cavities. The ex vivo trials conducted in Taiwan present the design and prototype of the portable LIAF imager used for analyzing 31 patients with 221 measurement points. Using the normalized factor of normal tissues under the excitation source with 365 nm of the central wavelength and without the bandpass filter, the results revealed that the sensitivity was larger than 84%, the specificity was not smaller than over 76%, the accuracy was about 80%, and the area under curve of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was achieved at about 87%, respectively. The fact shows the LIAF spectroscopy has the possibilities of ex vivo diagnosis and noninvasive examinations for oral cancer. ? 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",autofluorescence; LED; medical and biological imaging; multispectrum; optical diagnosis; oral cancer; tissue diagnostics statics for medicine,"Bandpass filters; Diagnosis; Diseases; Light sources; Medical imaging; Tissue; Autofluorescence; Medical and biological imaging; Multi-spectrum; Optical Diagnosis; Oral cancer; Tissue diagnostics; Light emitting diodes; adult; aged; diagnostic imaging; early cancer diagnosis; equipment design; female; fluorescence; human; light; male; metabolism; middle aged; mouth mucosa; mouth tumor; procedures; receiver operating characteristic; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; spectrofluorometry; squamous cell carcinoma; Taiwan; Adult; Aged; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Early Detection of Cancer; Equipment Design; Female; Fluorescence; Humans; Light; Male; Middle Aged; Mouth Mucosa; Mouth Neoplasms; Reproducibility of Results; ROC Curve; Sensitivity and Specificity; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85021643634

Specifically, reproductive tourism provides more medical choices to people who are unable to become pregnant or unmarried people whose access to reproductive technologies in their home countries is prevented by law. However, this practice has been a source of controversy: its transnational character increases the risk of pregnant and has drawn accusations of eugenic practices and focusing on profit at the expense of medicine. Therefore, this article investigates the use of assisted reproductive technologies to analyze the role of gamete transfer and reproductive tourism in globalization. After conducting a literature review, we found that most patients choose countries that provide high-quality care, have low medical costs, allow patients to quickly undergo surgery and obtain gametes, and have relatively less rigorous laws. The economic capital required for reproductive tourism and the class differences it delineates demonstrate the complexity of reproductive politics. Moreover, the price of gametes differs greatly between countries, which in some cases leads to the exploitation of donors or sellers. Consequently, it is necessary to actively formulate relevant laws and regulations to protect people's rights in reproductive tourism.",Assisted reproductive technologies; Gamete; Globalization; Medical tourism; Reproductive tourism,gamete; health care quality; human; human cell; medical tourism; politics; surgery,2-s2.0-85020740498

Nanomedicine aims to advance cancer treatment through functional nanocarriers that delivers one or more therapeutics to cancer tissue and cells with minimal off-target effects and suitable release kinetics and dosages. Although much effort has gone into developing circulating nanocarriers with targeting functionality for systemic administration, another alternative and straightforward approach is to utilize formulations to be administered directly to the site of action, such as pulmonary and intratumoral delivery. The combination of gene-silencing RNA with drugs in nanocarriers for localized delivery is emerging with promising results. In this review, the current progress and strategies for local co-administration of RNA and drug for synergistic effects and future potential in cancer treatment are presented and discussed. Key advances in RNA-drug anticancer synergy and localized delivery systems were combined with a review of the available literature on local co-administration of RNA and drug for cancer treatment. It is concluded that advanced delivery systems for local administration of gene-silencing RNA and drug hold potential in treatment of cancer, depending on indication. In particular, there are promising developments using pulmonary delivery and intratumoral delivery in murine models, but further research should be conducted on other local administration strategies, designs that achieve effective intracellular delivery and maximize synergy and feasibility for clinical use. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Combinatory treatment; Drug delivery system; RNA; Synergy; Therapeutic substance; Tumor,"antineoplastic agent; benzethonium chloride; bevacizumab; cisplatin; DNA polymerase Rev1; doxorubicin; gold nanoparticle; gold nanorod; K ras protein; microRNA; multidrug resistance protein 1; n (2,3 dihydroxypropoxy) 3,4 difluoro 2 (2 fluoro 4 iodoanilino)benzamide; nanocarrier; paclitaxel; polyethyleneimine; protein bcl 2; protein mcl 1; small interfering RNA; solid lipid nanoparticle; survivin; antineoplastic agent; microRNA; small interfering RNA; cancer gene therapy; cancer inhibition; cancer resistance; colorectal cancer; conjugation; controlled drug release; drug penetration; gene silencing; hydrogel; intrapulmonary drug administration; lung cancer; melanoma B16; multidrug resistance; nanomedicine; nonhuman; ovary cancer; peritumoral drug administration; phototherapy; prostate cancer; Review; RNAi therapeutics; triple negative breast cancer; tumor regression; gene therapy; genetics; human; multimodality cancer therapy; Neoplasms; Antineoplastic Agents; Combined Modality Therapy; Gene Silencing; Genetic Therapy; Humans; MicroRNAs; Neoplasms; RNA, Small Interfering",2-s2.0-85016314834

MicroRNAs that act as tumor suppressors have been recognized as a next-generation tumor therapy, and the restoration of tumor-suppressive microRNAs using microRNA replacements or mimics may be a less toxic, more effective strategy due to fewer off-target effects. Here, we designed the novel multifunctional oligonucleotide nanocarrier complex composed of a tumor-targeting aptamer sequence specific to mucin 1 (MUC1), poly-cytosine region for fluorescent silver nanocluster (AgNC) synthesis, and complimentary sequence for microRNA miR-34a loading. MiR-34a was employed because of its therapeutic effect of inhibiting oncogene expression and inducing apoptosis in carcinomas. By monitoring the intrinsic fluorescence of AgNC, it was clearly shown that the constructed complex (MUC1-AgNCm-miR-34a) enters MCF-7 cells. To evaluate the efficacy of this nanocarrier for microRNA delivery, we investigated the gene and protein expression levels of downstream miR-34a targets (BCL-2, CDK6, and CCND1) by quantitative PCR and western blotting, respectively, and the results indicated their effective inhibition by miR-34a.

Our study investigated the incidences of autoimmune diseases among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Taiwan during 2000-2012. Methods The Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database was used to identify PLWHA. The incidence densities of systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases were calculated, and age-Adjusted, sex-Adjusted and period-Adjusted standardised incidence rates (SIRs) were obtained by using two million people from the general population as controls. To examine the effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the incidence of autoimmune diseases, the incidence densities and SIRs of autoimmune diseases were calculated after stratifying PLWHA by HAART status. Results Of the 20? ..444 PLWHA identified, the overall mean (SD) age was 30.1 (11.0) years; 67.2% of the subjects received HAART. As compared with the general population, SIRs were higher for incident Sj?gren syndrome (SIR=1.64; 95% CI 1.24 to 2.13), psoriasis (SIR=2.05; 95% CI 1.67 to 2.48), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (SIR=2.59; 95% CI 1.53 to 4.09), autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (SIR=35.06; 95% CI 23.1 to 51.02) and uveitis (SIR=2.50; 95% CI 2.05 to 3.02), but were lower for incident ankylosing spondyloarthritis (SIR=0.70; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.99). When the effect of HAART on incident autoimmune diseases was considered, PLWHA who received HAART had higher SIRs for psoriasis, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and uveitis, but had lower risks of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondyloarthritis. In contrast, PLWHA who did not receive HAART had higher SIRs for Sj?gren syndrome, psoriasis, RA, SLE, scleroderma, polymyositis, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

Among the 4256 E. coli K12 proteins, 875 sulfated proteins were identified using antisulfotyrosine primary and Cy3-labeled antimouse secondary antibodies. Our findings add considerably to the list of potential proteins subjected to tyrosine sulfation.

The role of COX-2 in dengue virus (DENV) replication remains unclear. In the present study, we observed an increased level of COX-2 in patients with dengue fever compared with healthy donors. Consistent with the clinical data, an elevated level of COX-2 expression was also observed in DENV-infected ICR suckling mice. Using cell-based experiments, we revealed that DENV-2 infection significantly induced COX-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in human hepatoma Huh-7 cells. The exogenous expression of COX-2 or PGE2 treatment dose-dependently enhanced DENV-2 replication. In contrast, COX-2 gene silencing and catalytic inhibition sufficiently suppressed DENV-2 replication. In an ICR suckling mouse model, we identified that the COX-2 inhibitor NS398 protected mice from succumbing to life-threatening DENV-2 infection. By using COX-2 promoter-based analysis and specific inhibitors against signaling molecules, we identified that NF- B and MAPK/JNK are critical factors for DENV-2-induced COX-2 expression and viral replication. Altogether, our results reveal that COX-2 is an important factor for DENV replication and can serve as a potential target for developing therapeutic agents against DENV infection. ?

Among these methods, molecular docking and quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) play key roles for lead discovery and optimization. Here, we propose an integrated approach with core strategies to identify the protein-ligand hot spots for QSAR models and lead optimization. These core strategies are: 1) to generate both residue-based and atom-based interactions as the features; 2) to identify compound common and specific skeletons; and 3) to infer consensus features for QSAR models. Results: We evaluated our methods and new strategies on building QSAR models of human acetylcholinesterase (huAChE). The leave-one-out cross validation values q 2 and r 2 of our huAChE QSAR model are 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. The experimental results show that the selected features (resides/atoms) are important for enzymatic functions and stabling the protein structure by forming key interactions (e.g., stack forces and hydrogen bonds) between huAChE and its inhibitors. Finally, we applied our methods to arthrobacter globiformis histamine oxidase (AGHO) which is correlated to heart failure and diabetic. Conclusions: Based on our AGHO QSAR model, we identified a new substrate verified by bioassay experiments for AGHO. These results show that our methods and new strategies can yield stable and high accuracy QSAR models.

However, the relationship between TS and sleep disorders in children is less investigated. This nationwide population-based case-control study aimed to determine the correlation of TS and sleep disorders in children. Methods: Patients aged less than 18 years with newly diagnosed TS from 2001 to 2007 were collected (n = 1124) using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database and were compared with a comparison cohort (n = 3372). The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for developing sleep disorders was calculated by multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Results: TS was more prevalent in boys, with a male to female ratio of 3.16:1. TS group also had significantly higher urbanization level of residence than controls (p < .001). The overall incidence rate of sleep disorders was 7.24? in children with TS, compared to 3.53? in controls. The TS group was associated with a significantly higher rate of sleep disorders, with a crude HR of 2.05 (95% confidence inerval [CI] = 1.43-2.95, p < .001). Among the comorbidities of TS, anxiety disorder was associated with the highest risk for sleep disorders (crude HR = 3.26, 95% CI = 1.52-7.00, p < .001). The aHR for TS cohort to develop sleep disorders was 1.72 (95% CI = 1.16-2.53, p = .007). Conclusions: The increased risk of sleep disorders in children with TS cannot be fully attributed to its comorbidities, and TS is an independent risk factor for sleep disorders in children. ? 2017, Associated Professional Sleep Societies,LLC.

Determining which patients may be more likely to respond to treatment with thermoplastic MADs and to adhere to treatment would be of obvious clinical relevance. This was an experimental descriptive study (N = 60). Patients with OSA were instructed to wear a titratable thermoplastic MAD for 3 months. Treatment success was defined as a ?50% reduction from baseline in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) or AHI < 10 when wearing MAD. Adherence was defined as MAD use ?5 nights/week. Treatment was successful in 66.7% of patients and 60.0% were adherent. All polysomnographic parameters and visual analogue scale scores (sleep quality, snoring, waking refreshed) were significantly improved after treatment. The patients in whom treatment failed had significantly higher neck circumferences (39.3 cm vs. 37.5 cm, p = 0.014), higher baseline AHI values (26.6 vs. 18.0, p = 0.016), and smaller AHI reduction (-31.8 vs -53.1, p < 0.001) than those in the group in whom treatment succeeded.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for early assessment on chronic diseases by mining sequential risk patterns with time interval information from diagnostic clinical records using sequential rules mining, and classification modeling techniques. With a complete workflow, the proposed framework consists of four phases namely data preprocessing, risk pattern mining, classification modeling, and post analysis. For empiricasl evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework with a case study on early assessment of COPD. Through experimental evaluation on a large-scale nationwide clinical database in Taiwan, our approach can not only derive rich sequential risk patterns but also extract novel patterns with valuable insights for further medical investigation such as discovering novel markers and better treatments.

However, it is more difficult for the disabled and bedridden patients, who might totally depend on others, to operate the conventional electric beds by themselves. Different from the current controlling method, the proposed system provides a new concept of controlling the electric bed via visual stimuli, without manual operation. The disabled patients could operate the electric bed by focusing on the control icons of a visual stimulus tablet in the proposed system. Besides, a wearable and wireless EEG acquisition module was also implemented to monitor the EEG signals of patients.

The ability to efficiently capture and isolate cells and other biomolecules from peripheral whole blood for downstream analyses is a necessary requirement. Graphene oxide (GO) is an attractive template nanomaterial for such biosensing applications. Favorable properties include its two-dimensional architecture and wide range of functionalization chemistries, offering significant potential to tailor affinity toward aromatic functional groups expressed in biomolecules of interest. However, a limitation of current techniques is that as-synthesized GO nanosheets are used directly in sensing applications, and the benefits of their structural modification on the device performance have remained unexplored. Here, we report a microfluidic-free, sensitive, planar device on treated GO substrates to enable quick and efficient capture of Class-II MHC-positive cells from murine whole blood. We achieve this by using a mild thermal annealing treatment on the GO substrates, which drives a phase transformation through oxygen clustering. Using a combination of experimental observations and MD simulations, we demonstrate that this process leads to improved reactivity and density of functionalization of cell capture agents, resulting in an enhanced cell capture efficiency of 92 ± 7% at room temperature, almost double the efficiency afforded by devices made using as-synthesized GO (54 ± 3%). Our work highlights a scalable, cost-effective, general approach to improve the functionalization of GO, which creates diverse opportunities for various next-generation device applications. ? 2017 American Chemical Society.",enhanced cell capture efficiency; graphene oxide; improved functionalization; microfluidic-free; oxygen clustering; phase transformation; thermal annealing,Biomolecules; Blood; Cells; Cost effectiveness; Cytology; Diseases; Efficiency; Microfluidics; Nanosheets; Oxygen; Phase transitions; Aromatic functional groups; Cell capture; Functionalizations; Functionalized graphene; Graphene oxides; Structural modifications; Thermal annealing treatment; Thermal-annealing; Graphene; graphite; nanomaterial; oxide; oxygen; animal; cell line; cell separation; chemistry; molecular dynamics; mouse; Animals; Cell Line; Cell Separation; Graphite; Mice; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Nanostructures; Oxides; Oxygen,2-s2.0-85014190959

Materials and methods Here we reveal the differentially expressed miRNAs by Solexa? deep sequencing from the blood of human and mice after the aqueous extract treatment. Among these overexpressed innate miRNAs both in human and mice, let-7a is able to target the NS1 region (nt 3313-3330) of dengue virus (DENV) serotypes 1, 2 and 4 predicated by the target predication software. Results We confirmed that let-7a could target DENV2 at the predicated NS1 sequence and suppress DENV2 replication demonstrated by luciferase-reporter activity, RT-PCR, real-time PCR, Western blotting and plaque assay. ICR-suckling mice consumed honeysuckle aqueous extract either before or after intracranial injection with DENV2 showed decreased levels of NS1 RNA and protein expression accompanied with alleviated disease symptoms, decreased virus load, and prolonged survival time. Similar results were observed when DENV2-infected mice were intracranially injected with let-7a.

However, the mechanism of this cellular uptake process is not yet fully understood. In this study, a time-lapse single-particle light-sheet microscopy technique was implemented to obtain a parallel visualization of the translocating process of individual human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) transactivator of transcription (Tat) peptide conjugated quantum dots (TatP-QDs) in complex cellular terrains. Here, TatP-QDs served as nanoscale dynamic pens, which depict remarkable trajectory aggregates of TatP-QDs on the cell surface. Spectral-embedding analysis of the trajectory aggregates revealed a manifold formed by isotropic diffusion and a fraction of directed movement, possibly caused by interaction between the Tat peptides and heparan sulfate groups on the plasma membrane. Further analysis indicated that the membrane deformation induced by Tat-peptide attachment increased with the disruption of the actin framework in cytochalasin D (cyto D)-treated cells, yielding higher interactions on the TatP-QDs. In native cells, the Tat peptides can remodel the actin framework to reduce their interaction with the local membrane environment. Characteristic hot spots for interaction were detected on the membrane, suggesting that a funnel passage may have formed for the Tat-coated particles. This finding offers valuable insight into the cellular delivery of nanoscale cargo, suggesting an avenue for direct therapeutic delivery. ? 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Actin filaments; Cell-penetrating peptides; Heparan sulfate proteoglycan; Live cell; Plasma membrane; Single-particle tracking,"Aggregates; Cell membranes; Cytology; Diseases; Nanocrystals; Peptides; Polypeptides; Sulfur compounds; Viruses; Actin filament; Cell-penetrating peptide; Live cell; Proteoglycans; Single particle tracking; Semiconductor quantum dots; nanomaterial; peptide; quantum dot; transactivator protein; cell count; cell survival; gene translocation; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Cell Count; Cell Survival; Gene Products, tat; HIV-1; Nanostructures; Peptides; Quantum Dots; Translocation, Genetic",2-s2.0-85012237735

The detailed clinical manifestation and causative gene for each subgroup of CMD are quite variable. This study aims to analyze the phenotypes and genotypes of Taiwanese patients with CMD as the epidemiology of CMD varies among populations and has been scantly described in Asia. Methods: A total of 48 patients suspected to have CMD were screened and categorized by histochemistry and immunohistochemistry studies. Different genetic analyses, including next-generation sequencing (NGS), were selected, based on the clinical and pathological findings. Results: We identified 17 patients with sarcolemma-specific collagen VI deficiency (SSCD), 6 patients with merosin deficiency, two with reduced alpha-dystroglycan staining, and two with striking lymphocyte infiltration in addition to dystrophic change on muscle pathology. Fourteen in 15 patients with SSCD, were shown to have COL6A1, COL6A2 or COL6A3 mutations by NGS analysis; all showed marked distal hyperlaxity and normal intelligence but the overall severity was less than in previously reported patients from other populations. All six patients with merosin deficiency had mutations in LAMA2. They showed relatively uniform phenotype that were compatible with previous studies, except for higher proportion of mental retardation with epilepsy. With reduced alpha-dystroglycan staining, one patient was found to carry mutations in POMT1 while another patient carried mutations in TRAPPC11. LMNA mutations were found in the two patients with inflammatory change on muscle pathology. They were clinically characterized by neck flexion limitation and early joint contracture, but no cardiac problem had developed yet. Conclusion: Muscle pathology remains helpful in guiding further molecular analyses by direct sequencing of certain genes or by target capture/NGS as a second-tier diagnostic tool, and is crucial for establishing the genotype-phenotype correlation. We also determined the frequencies of the different types of CMD in our cohort which is important for the development of a specific care system for each disease. ? 2017 Liang et al.

This study aims to investigate the preclinical feasibility of using naringin, a naturally derived polymethoxylated flavonoid compound with antiinflammatory properties, to inhibit periodontitis induction via a thermogelling and pH-responsive injectable hydrogel. Methods: The hydrogel was made of amphipathic carboxymethyl-hexanoyl chitosan (CHC), β-glycerol phosphate (β-GP), and glycerol. Thermogelling and pH-responsive characteristics of the hydrogel, as well as cell viability after treatment with the hydrogel containing naringin, were evaluated in vitro. Hydrogel was subgingivally delivered when experimental periodontitis was induced in vivo, and therapeutic effect was evaluated with microcomputed tomography imaging, histology, and expression of inflammation-associated genes, including toll-like receptor (TLR)2, the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), myeloid differentiation primary response gene-88, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Results: The hydrogel was consistently fluidic at 4°C but rapidly gelled at 37°C. Release of naringin was faster at pH 5.5 to 6.5, and viability was significantly promoted by treatment with 0.85% naringin. Naringin-carrying CHC-β-GP-glycerol hydrogel sites showed significantly reduced periodontal bone loss (P <0.05) and inflammatory infiltration (P <0.01) as well as significantly downregulated TLR2 (P <0.05), RAGE (P <0.01), and TNF-α (P <0.05) relative to the sites with experimental periodontitis alone. Conclusion: Naringin-carrying CHC-β-GP-glycerol colloidal hydrogel can be used to inhibit induction of experimental periodontitis with favorable handling and inflammation-responsive characteristics. ? 2017 American Academy of Periodontology.

HCC is one of the major causes of cancer deaths in worldwide, which remains poor prognosis and is clinically urgent for discovering early diagnostic markers. However, except for serum Hp, the correlation of tumor Hp expression with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression is still unclear. In this study, we evaluated and identified the tissue Hp expression as a prognostic marker to predict the survival rate of HCC patients. To evaluate the prognostic value of Hp expression for HCC, two cohorts were enrolled in our study, including total 130 matched pair tissue sections (both adjacent non-tumorous and tumor tissue derived from same patient) of HCC patients from Changhua Christian Hospital (CCH) and total 316 RNA-seq data with clinical information of HCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In contrast to other types of cancers, HCC tumor tissues have lower Hp protein expression in CCH cohort and have lower Hp mRNA expression in TCGA cohort as compared with adjacent non-tumorous tissues (p < 0.001). Moreover, lower Hp expression is significantly correlated with different stages of HCC cancer differentiation in CCH cohort (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.001). Most importantly, lower Hp expression is highly correlated with poor five-year overall survival rate in TCGA cohort (p < 0.01). Based on our data, we conclude that tissue Hp expression positively correlates with better HCC tumor differentiation and increased five-year overall survival rate of HCC patients. The results indicated that tissue Hp is potentially a prognostic marker for HCC patients. Our findings may further provide a new insight of effective treatments along with biopsy diagnosis of HCC patients. ? 2017 Tai et al.

However, CMV disease rarely develops in immunocompetent patients, and reported cases often present with a mild, self-limiting course, without severe life-threatening sequelae. While the colon is the most common gastrointestinal site affected by CMV disease in immunocompetent patients, rectal involvement is rarely reported. CMV proctitis can present in two distinct forms, primary and reactivated. However, reactivated CMV proctitis is rarely reported as a causative etiology of nosocomial diarrhea, except in transplant patients. Herein we present a case of reactivated CMV proctitis in an immunocompetent patient, presenting as nosocomial diarrhea. Previously reported cases of reactivated CMV proctitis in immunocompetent patients are also reviewed. Case presentation: A 79-year-old female was admitted because of metabolic encephalopathy caused by dehydration and hypernatremia. The patient's consciousness level returned rapidly after fluid supplementation. However, she subsequently presented with abdominal pain and diarrhea on day 8 of admission. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography on day 10 of admission demonstrated inflammation around the rectum, suggesting proctitis. Colonoscopy on day 16 of admission showed a giant ulcer at the rectum. Pathology of rectal biopsy confirmed CMV infection. The patient recovered without sequelae after 38days of valganciclovir treatment. Follow-up colonoscopy revealed a healed ulcer over the rectum. Ten cases in the literature, plus our case, with reactivated CMV proctitis in immunocompetent patients were reviewed. We found that most patients were elderly (mean, 72years) with a high prevalence of diabetes mellitus (54.5%). Cardinal manifestations are often non-specific (diarrhea, hematochezia, tenesmus), and eight (72.7%) developed CMV proctitis following a preceding acute, life-threatening disease, rather than as an initial presentation on admission. These manifestations frequently develop during hospitalization, and are thus often regarded as nosocomial diarrhea. Conclusions: Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of nosocomial onset of reactivated CMV proctitis in patients hospitalized due to a preceding critical illness, although the benefits of antiviral therapy remain unclear. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Case report; Cytomegalovirus; Immunocompetent; Proctitis,"aciclovir; ceftriaxone; immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; valganciclovir; ganciclovir; valganciclovir; abdominal pain; aged; Article; brain atrophy; case report; central nervous system infection; Clostridium difficile infection; colonoscopy; computer assisted tomography; cytomegalovirus infection; dehydration; diabetes mellitus; diarrhea; dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; enteric feeding; female; follow up; Glasgow coma scale; hospital infection; human; human tissue; ischemic heart disease; major depression; metabolic encephalopathy; proctitis; rectum biopsy; rectum ulcer; tachycardia; virus reactivation; analogs and derivatives; biopsy; cross infection; Cytomegalovirus; cytomegalovirus infection; diarrhea; immunocompetence; immunology; middle aged; pathology; pathophysiology; proctitis; rectum; virology; virus activation; x-ray computed tomography; Abdominal Pain; Aged; Biopsy; Colonoscopy; Cross Infection; Cytomegalovirus; Cytomegalovirus Infections; Diarrhea; Female; Ganciclovir; Humans; Immunocompetence; Middle Aged; Proctitis; Rectum; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Virus Activation",2-s2.0-85011101290

Interactive displays armed with natural user interfaces (NUIs) will likely lead the next breakthrough in consumer electronics, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are often regarded as the ultimate NUI-enabling machines to respond to human emotions and mental states. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are a commonly used BCI modality due to the ease of detection and high information transfer rates. However, the presence of flickering stimuli may cause user discomfort and can even induce migraines and seizures. With the aim of designing visual stimuli that can be embedded into video images, this study developed a novel approach to induce detectable SSVEPs using a composition of red/green/blue flickering lights. Approach. Based on the opponent theory of colour vision, this study used 32 Hz/40 Hz rectangular red-green or red-blue LED light pulses with a 50% duty cycle, balanced/equal luminance and 0°/180° phase shifts as the stimulating light sources and tested their efficacy in producing SSVEP responses with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) while reducing the perceived flickering sensation. Main results. The empirical results from ten healthy subjects showed that dual-colour lights flickering at 32 Hz/40 Hz with a 50% duty cycle and 180° phase shift achieved a greater than 90% detection accuracy with little or no flickering sensation. Significance. As a first step in developing an embedded SSVEP stimulus in commercial displays, this study provides a foundation for developing a combination of three primary colour flickering backlights with adjustable luminance proportions to create a subtle flickering polychromatic light that can elicit SSVEPs at the basic flickering frequency. ? 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.",brain-computer interface; canonical correlation analysis; interactive display systems; polychromatic; steady-state visual evoked potentials; subtle flickering; visual stimuli,"Color; Color vision; Display devices; Electrophysiology; Flickering; Human computer interaction; Interface states; Light; Luminance; Signal to noise ratio; User interfaces; Canonical correlation analysis; Interactive display system; polychromatic; Steady state visual evoked potentials; Visual stimulus; Brain computer interface; adult; amplifier; Article; blue light; brain computer interface; color vision; computer; controlled study; critical flicker fusion; electroencephalogram; electroencephalograph electrode; female; generator; green light; human; human experiment; light; light emitting diode; luminance; male; normal human; occipital lobe; priority journal; recorder; red light; signal detection; signal noise ratio; steady state visual evoked potential; stroboscope; videorecording; visual evoked potential; visual stimulation; color; computer interface; critical flicker fusion; photostimulation; physiology; procedures; visual evoked potential; Adult; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Color; Color Vision; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Female; Flicker Fusion; Humans; Male; Photic Stimulation; User-Computer Interface",2-s2.0-85010377987

Design A retrospective cohort study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). Setting A university teaching hospital. Patients Patients (N?=?158) with posterior deep intramural, intraligamental, or cervical leiomyomas; 81 patients underwent USAS (suspension group), and 77 patients did not (control group) concomitantly with laparoscopic myomectomy. Interventions Transabdominal USAS was performed for all eligible patients undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy using a 2-0 synthetic, monofilament, nonabsorbable polypropylene suture. One end of the double-headed straight needles of the polypropylene suture was inserted into the pelvic cavity through the abdomen to “lift” or “retract” the uterus to allow for the main tumor to be completely exposed and excised. Measurements and Main Results The average time to create USAS was 2.5?minutes. For the suspension and control groups, the average number of abdominal ports was 3 and 4.4 (p?<?.001), the average blood loss was 96.3 and 201.5?mL (p?<?.001), and the average operative time was 50.8 and 91.2?minutes (p?<?.001), respectively. There was no significant difference in complications (4.9% vs 9.1%, p?=?.303), but there was a significant difference in conversion to laparotomy (1.2% vs 10.4%, p?=?.009). At the 3-year follow-up, there were no significant differences in gynecologic and reproductive outcomes, including leiomyoma recurrence, uterine rupture, and pregnancy and live birth rates. The ratio of conversion to laparotomy (odds ratio?=?0.108; 95% confidence interval, 0.013–0.884) was much lower in the suspension group.

Methods We conducted a retrospective nested case-control study using data from the National Health Insurance Database of Taiwan between 2000 and 2011. A total of 3292 BD patients, 1684 with cataracts and 1608 controls matched for age, sex, and index date, were included. Antipsychotic drug exposure was categorized by type of drug and duration of use. A conditional logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the association. Results Among BD patients, we found significantly reduced odds ratio (OR) of cataract development among past (adjusted OR (AOR), 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.62–0.89; p=0.001) and continuous users (AOR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.59–0.85; p<0.001) of atypical antipsychotics. No association was found between the odds of cataract development and typical antipsychotics. Besides, concomitant use of antidepressants (AOR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.06–1.43; p=0.007) and mood stabilizers (AOR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.06–1.42; p=0.007) were associated with increased odds of cataract development. Limitations Some important contributors to cataract development such as family history of cataract, smoking and alcohol exposure could not be measured from the claims data and this may confound the results. Conclusions Reduced odds of cataract were found in patients with BD taking atypical antipsychotics. However, given that BD patients often have risk factors for developing cataract, regular ocular evaluations are recommended for those treated with antipsychotics drugs. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Antidepressant; Antipsychotic; Bipolar disorder; Cataract; Mood stabilizer,"antidepressant agent; atypical antipsychotic agent; mood stabilizer; antidepressant agent; neuroleptic agent; adult; Article; bipolar disorder; case control study; cataract; comorbidity; controlled study; data base; female; glaucoma; human; major clinical study; male; national health insurance; priority journal; retina disease; retrospective study; risk factor; Taiwan; bipolar disorder; cataract; factual database; middle aged; odds ratio; Adult; Antidepressive Agents; Antipsychotic Agents; Bipolar Disorder; Case-Control Studies; Cataract; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan",2-s2.0-84997666971

Variations in the targeting efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties are investigated by quantitatively controlling the surface density of different peptides on the nanoparticles. In vitro permeability in a human follicle-associated epithelium model and cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 cells indicate that the nanocarriers conjugated with high RGD peptide concentrations display a higher permeability due to the existence of M cells with higher transcytosis activity, but a higher concentration of conjugated Lyp-1 peptide exhibits the lowest cell viability. Being benefited from specific targeting of peptide conjugation, improved bioavailability and enhanced tumor accumulation are achieved by the GLD-PL/TG NPs, leading to better antitumor efficacy. The results of in vivo biodistribution and antitumor studies reveal that the effect of LyP-1 peptide is more predominant than that of RGD peptide.

Here, we investigated the role of DDX3 in hepatic lipid metabolism. We found that HCV infection severely reduced DDX3 expression. Analysis of intracellular triglyceride and secreted ApoB indicated that lipid accumulations were increased while ApoB secretion were decreased in DDX3 knockdown HuH7 and HepG2 cell lines. Down-regulation of DDX3 significantly decreased protein and transcript expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), a key regulator of liver lipid homeostasis. Moreover, DDX3 interacted with hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) and small heterodimer partner (SHP), and synergistically up-regulated HNF4-mediated transactivation of MTP promoter via its ATPase activity. Further investigation revealed that DDX3 interacted with CBP/p300 and increased the promoter binding affinity of HNF4 by enhancing HNF4 acetylation. Additionally, DDX3 partially relieved the SHP-mediated suppression on MTP promoter by competing with SHP for HNF4 binding which disrupted the inactive HNF4/SHP heterodimer while promoted the formation of the active HNF4 homodimer. Collectively, these results imply that DDX3 regulates MTP gene expression and lipid homeostasis through interplay with HNF4 and SHP, which may also reveal a novel mechanism of HCV-induced steatosis. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"apolipoprotein B; carrier protein; cell receptor; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein binding protein; DDX3X protein, human; DEAD box protein; hepatocyte nuclear factor 4; microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2; protein binding; triacylglycerol; acetylation; chemistry; gene knockdown; genetics; hepatitis C; homeostasis; human; intracellular space; lipid metabolism; metabolism; nucleotide sequence; pathology; promoter region; protein domain; protein multimerization; transcription initiation; tumor cell line; upregulation; Acetylation; Apolipoproteins B; Base Sequence; Carrier Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; CREB-Binding Protein; DEAD-box RNA Helicases; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Hepatitis C; Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4; Homeostasis; Humans; Intracellular Space; Lipid Metabolism; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Binding; Protein Domains; Protein Multimerization; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Transcriptional Activation; Triglycerides; Up-Regulation",2-s2.0-85010931725

The biodiversity of gut microbiota is affected by ethnicities and environmental factors such as dietary habits or medicine intake, and three enterotypes of the human gut microbiome were announced in 2011. These enterotypes are not significantly correlated with gender, age, or body weight but are influenced by long-term dietary habits. However, to date, only two enterotypes (predominantly consisting of Bacteroides and Prevotella) have shown these characteristics in previous research; the third enterotype remains ambiguous. Understanding the enterotypes can improve the knowledge of the relationship between microbiota and human health. Results: We obtained 181 human fecal samples from adults in Taiwan. Microbiota compositions were analyzed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, which is a culture-independent method of constructing microbial community profiles by sequencing 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA). In these samples, 17,675,898 sequencing reads were sequenced, and on average, 215 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified for each sample. In this study, the major bacteria in the enterotypes identified from the fecal samples were Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Enterobacteriaceae, and their correlation with dietary habits was confirmed. A microbial interaction network in the gut was observed on the basis of the amount of short-chain fatty acids, pH value of the intestine, and composition of the bacterial community (enterotypes). Finally, a decision tree was derived to provide a predictive model for the three enterotypes. The accuracies of this model in training and independent testing sets were 97.2 and 84.0%, respectively. Conclusions: We used NGS technology to characterize the microbiota and constructed a predictive model. The most significant finding was that Enterobacteriaceae, the predominant subtype, could be a new subtype of enterotypes in the Asian population. ? 2017 The Author(s).",16S rDNA; Enterotype; Gut microbiome; Next-generation sequencing; Predictive model,"DNA 16S; short chain fatty acid; RNA 16S; adult; Article; Bacteroides; controlled study; dietary intake; Enterobacteriaceae; feces analysis; female; human; limit of quantitation; male; microbial community; microbial diversity; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; Prevotella; Taiwan; taxonomy; biodiversity; cluster analysis; decision tree; feces; genetics; high throughput sequencing; intestine flora; metagenome; metagenomics; microbiology; phenotype; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Adult; Biodiversity; Cluster Analysis; Decision Trees; Feces; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Male; Metagenome; Metagenomics; Phenotype; Reproducibility of Results; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sensitivity and Specificity",2-s2.0-85010976772

The cause of this disease is often unknown, and previous studies revealed that it might be caused by a virus, vaccine or tumor. It occurs more often in females than in males. Several cases were reported to be related to vaccination such as the H1N1 vaccine and tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis and polio vaccines. In this study, we reported an anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis case that may be caused by Japanese encephalitis vaccination. To investigate the association between anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and vaccination, we analyzed the phylogenetic relationship of the microRNAs, which significantly regulate these vaccine viruses or bacteria, and the phylogenetic relationship of these viruses and bacteria.

With aids of binaural cues and minima controlled recursive average (MCRA) approach, the proposed NR algorithm consists of a directional mask and an estimated mask. The directional mask exploits the interaural time difference (ITD) together with the interaural level difference (ILD) of two input sources to attenuate the lateral noise, while the estimated mask is used to further reduce the background noise and the coherence noise. Investigated by the circumstances with the -3 dB, 0 dB, and 3 dB, respectively, cocktail-party effect, the simulation results show that the proposed binaural NR algorithm gains an average of approximately 5.07 dB SNR improvement. Moreover, the speech intelligibility index (SII) performance is superior, comparing that with the state-of-the-art NR algorithms for hearing aids. The proposed binaural NR algorithm has been implemented in TSMC 90 nm CMOS high-VT technology. The chip design is operated by 288 KHz and consumes approximately 121.6 μW (@1 V). The chip design can be operated by 0.6 V for real-time processing 24 kHz audio.

To date, numerous studies have demonstrated the uptake of nanoparticles by cells, but their intracellular processing through selective autophagy remains unclear. Here we show that carbon-based nanodiamonds (NDs) coated with ubiquitin (Ub) bind to autophagy receptors (SQSTM1 [sequestosome 1], OPTN [optineurin], and CALCOCO2/NDP52 [calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2]) and are then linked to MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) for entry into the selective autophagy pathway. NDs are ultimately delivered to lysosomes. Ectopically expressed SQSTM1-green fluorescence protein (GFP) could bind to the Ub-coated NDs. By contrast, the Ub-associated domain mutant of SQSTM1 (ΔUBA)-GFP did not bind to the Ub-coated NDs. Chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, prevented the ND-containing autophagosomes from fusing with lysosomes. Furthermore, autophagy receptors OPTN and CALCOCO2/NDP52, involved in the processing of bacteria, were found to be involved in the selective autophagy of NDs. However, ND particles located in the lysosomes of cells did not induce mitotic blockage, senescence, or cell death. Single ND clusters in the lysosomes of cells were observed in the xenografted human lung tumors of nude mice. This study demonstrated for the first time that Ub-coated nanoparticles bind to autophagy receptors for entry into the selective autophagy pathway, facilitating their delivery to lysosomes. ? 2017 Taylor & Francis.",autophagy receptors; lysosome; nanodiamonds; selective autophagy; ubiquitin,"calcium binding and coiled coil domain 2 protein; calcium binding protein; carbon nanoparticle; chloroquine; free radical; green fluorescent protein; nanodiamond; optineurin; sequestosome 1; ubiquitin; unclassified drug; cell receptor; MAP1LC3 protein, mouse; MAP1LC3A protein, human; microtubule associated protein; nanodiamond; NDP52 protein, mouse; nerve protein; nuclear dot protein 52, human; nuclear protein; protein binding; recombinant protein; sequestosome 1; SQSTM1 protein, human; Sqstm1 protein, mouse; ubiquitin; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; autophagosome; bacterium; cell aging; cell death; controlled study; ectopic expression; human; human cell; lung tumor; lysosome; material coating; mitosis; mouse; nonhuman; protein binding; protein expression; receptor binding; selective autophagy; sucrose density gradient centrifugation; tumor xenograft; A-549 cell line; animal; autophagy; cancer transplantation; chemistry; confocal microscopy; metabolism; nude mouse; tumor cell line; A549 Cells; Animals; Autophagy; Cell Death; Cell Line, Tumor; Cellular Senescence; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Lysosomes; Mice; Mice, Nude; Microscopy, Confocal; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Nanodiamonds; Neoplasm Transplantation; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Nuclear Proteins; Protein Binding; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Recombinant Proteins; Sequestosome-1 Protein; Ubiquitin",2-s2.0-85002179231

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) are major peptidases of RAS components and play counteracting functions through angiotensin II (Ang II)/ATIR and angiotensin-(1–7) (Ang-(1–7))/Mas axis, respectively. Methods: There were 360 uremic patients on regular hemodialysis (HD) treatment (inclusive of 119 HD patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and 241 HD patients without CVD and 50 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Plasma ACE, ACE2, Ang II and Ang-(1–7) levels of the HD patients were determined. Results: We compared pre-HD levels of plasma ACE, ACE2, Ang II and Ang-(1–7) in the HD patients with and without CVD to those of the controls. The HD patients, particularly those with CVD, showed a significant increase in the levels of ACE and Ang II, whereas ACE2 and Ang-(1–7) levels were lower than those in the healthy controls. Therefore, imbalanced ACE/ACE2 was observed in the HD patients with CVD. In the course of a single HD session, the plasma ACE, ACE/ACE2 and Ang II levels in the HD patients with CVD were increased from pre-HD to post-HD. On the contrary, ACE2 levels were decreased after the HD session. These changes were not detected in the HD patients without CVD. Conclusions: Pathogenically imbalanced circulating ACE/ACE2 was detected in the HD patients, particularly those with CVD. HD session could increase ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis and decrease ACE2/ Ang-(1–7)/Mas axis activity in the circulation of HD patients with CVD. ? 2017, The Author(s).",Angiotensin converting enzyme; Angiotensin converting enzyme II; Cardiovascular diseases; Hemodialysis; Renin-angiotensin system; Uremic patient,"angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; angiotensin[1-7]; calcium channel blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; recombinant erythropoietin; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; adult; aged; antihypertensive therapy; Article; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; chronic kidney failure; congestive heart failure; controlled study; coronary artery disease; female; glomerulus filtration rate; heart infarction; hemodialysis; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; middle aged; priority journal; prospective study; protein blood level; uremia; blood; cardiovascular disease; complication; uremia; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Middle Aged; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Prospective Studies; Uremia",2-s2.0-85050592728

The cagA gene product, CagA, is translocated into gastric epithelial cells and perturbs host cellular biological functions. Etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor widely used to couple DNA damage to apoptosis, is a common cytotoxic agent used for advanced gastric cancer. We investigate the effect of CagA on etoposideinduced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells to elucidate whether CagA play a role in gastric carcinogenesis via impairing DNA damage-dependent apoptosis. AGS cell lines stably expressing CagA isolated from H. pylori 26695 strain were established. In the presence of etoposide, viability of parental AGS cells was decreased in a time-and dose-dependent manner, whereas CagA-expressing AGS cells were less susceptible to etoposide induced cell-killing effect. Suppression of etoposide-induced apoptosis was shown in CagA-expressing but not in parental AGS cells by DNA fragmentation, cell cycle, and annexin-V assays. This inhibitory effect of etoposide-induced apoptosis conferred by CagA was also demonstrated in SCM1 and MKN45 gastric cancer cell lines, with two additional chemotherapeutics, 5-FU and cisplatin. The effect of Akt activation on inhibition of etoposide-induced cytotoxicity by CagA was also evaluated. CagA expression and etoposide administration activate Akt in a dose-dependent manner. Enhancement of etoposide cytotoxicity by a PI-3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, was evident in parental but was attenuated in CagA-expressing AGS cells. CagA may activate Akt, either in the absence or presence of etoposide, potentially contributing to gastric carcinogenesis associated with H. pylori infection and therapeutic resistance by impairing DNA damage-dependent apoptosis. ?

Most previous studies have described swallowing behavior in terms of amplitude and duration. However, there is no objective and precise approach available for the evaluation of swallowing coordination. In order to evaluate swallowing coordination more precisely, a wireless and wearable monitoring device for dysphagia evaluation was designed for the present study in order to measure four muscle groups simultaneously during swallowing. In this context, the variations of the cross-correlation coefficients were defined as the discoordination index, a metric which can effectively reflect the differences between the surface EMG patterns of the bilateral muscle groups. The experimental results of this study show that the discoordination indices for dysphagic patients are significantly larger than those for healthy subjects and that these discoordination indices can be used as an effective means of evaluating the coordination between bilateral swallowing muscles. ? 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs) are one of the predictors that reflect the prognosis of cancer patients. There remains some uncertainty on the correlation of MIRs of liver cancer with the health expenditure of countries. Methods We therefore analyzed the correlation of MIRs from the GLOBOCAN 2012 database with the WHO rankings and the total expenditures on health/gross domestic product from WHO by linear regression analyses. A total of 29 countries were selected in this study according to the data quality and the incidence number. Results The results showed high rates of incidence/mortality and MIRs in less developed regions (0.92 vs. 0.96 for more vs. less developed regions). Among the continents, Asia has the highest incidence/mortality in case number, crude rate, and age-standardized rate. In terms of the MIR, Northern America has the lowest MIR and Latin America and the Caribbean have the highest MIRs (0.82 and 1.04, respectively). Finally, favorable MIRs are associated significantly with good WHO ranking and high expenditures on gross domestic product (P=0.048 and 0.025, respectively). Conclusion The MIR variation for liver cancer is thus found to be associated with the health expenditure and WHO ranking. ? Copyright 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In this study, seven monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of DENV were generated by hybridoma techniques. These antibodies can be divided into two groups: serotype-specific (DB6-1, DB12-3, and DB38-1) and nonspecific (consisting of antibodies DB16-1, DB20-6, DB29-1, and DB41-2). The B-cell epitopes of DB20-6 and DB29-1 were identified by phage display and site-directed mutagenesis, and its binding motif, WXXWGK, was revealed to correspond to amino acid residues 115-120 of the DENV-2 NS1 protein. A diagnostic platform, consisting of a serotype-specific capture antibody and a complex detection antibody, exhibited a detection limit of about 1 ng/mL, which is sufficient to detect NS1 in clinical serum samples from dengue patients. This diagnostic platform displayed better specificity and sensitivity than two examined commercial NS1 diagnostic platforms.

In vitro studies have shown that indoxyl sulfate decreases erythropoietin production. Whether this effect is seen in vivo remains unclear. Our goal was to explore the role of indoxyl sulfate in renal anemia. We found serum indoxyl sulfate levels are significantly and negatively associated with erythropoietin levels in human. A multiple stepwise linear regression analyses after adjustment for other independent parameters revealed that free indoxyl sulfate, and total indoxyl sulfate were significantly associated with erythropoietin levels. In animal studies, erythropoietin gene and protein expression were markedly inhibited in rats with chronic kidney disease; however, this effect was significantly reversed by lowering serum indoxyl sulfate with AST-120. Indoxyl sulfate may also inhibit erythropoietin expression in animal models with chronic kidney disease. These findings further support the role of indoxyl sulfate in the development of renal anemia. ?

Hicksii, induces apoptotic and autophagic cell death. However, whether DMGF suppresses tumor metastasis is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-metastatic activities of DMGF on the metastatic processes of melanoma cells in vivo and in vitro. A transwell assay showed that DMGF could effectively attenuate the motility of B16F10 cells, and the results of real-time PCR revealed that DMGF also suppressed the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). Moreover, DMGF did not influence tube formation but inhibited the migration of endothelial cells. Furthermore, animal models were used to monitor the effects of DMGF on tumor metastasis, and all models showed that DMGF significantly suppressed the metastatic behaviors of B16F10 cells, including intravasation, colonization, and invasion of the lymphatic duct. In addition, DMGF could also reduce the densities of the blood vessels in the tumor area in vivo. Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms of anti-metastatic activity revealed that DMGF can down-regulate the levels of key modulators of the Cdc42/Rac1 pathway to interfere in F-actin polymerization and suppress the formation of lamellipodia by reducing the phosphorylation of CREB. These data suggested that DMGF presents anti-metastatic activities in B16F10 melanoma cells. Here, we demonstrated that DMGF can inhibit the metastasis of highly invasive melanoma cancer cells through the down-regulation of F-actin polymerization. Considering these findings, DMGF may be further developed to serve as a chemoprevention drug for patients with metastatic melanoma. ?

This study enrolled patients who underwent SF reconstructive surgery in a tertiary referral center between November 2009 and October 2016. The drainage pathway of the SF venous return was routinely identified during the course of our operations to prevent damage during head and neck surgery. The venous return data of 70 patients were reviewed. The size of the flaps ranged from 15 to 84 cm2, and total flap loss was not observed in the case series. All of the submental arteries originated from the facial artery; however, the submental veins of 70 patients returned to either the internal jugular vein (IJV, 72.9%) or the external jugular vein (EJV, 27.1%). Our data suggest that drainage of the submental vein into the EJV, which has been previously overlooked, should receive greater attention during SF surgeries. The results support mandatory preservation of the EJV and IJV and indicate that vascular anatomy is a determining factor for successful SF raising. ? 2017 Lin et al.",Head and neck cancer; Reconstruction; Submental flap; Venous return,adult; aged; Article; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; carotid artery; chemoradiotherapy; clinical practice; external jugular vein; facial artery; female; head and neck cancer; human; internal jugular vein; major clinical study; male; neck dissection; outcome assessment; reconstructive surgery; retrospective study; sternocleidomastoid muscle; submental flap; surgical anatomy; surgical technique; survival rate; vascularization; venous return,2-s2.0-85029713831

Several recent studies demonstrated various advantages of hybrid BCI systems in terms of an improved accuracy or number of commands available for the user. But still, BCI systems are far from realization for daily use. Having high performance with less number of channels is one of the challenging issues that persists, especially with hybrid BCI systems, where multiple channels are necessary to record information from two or more EEG signal components. Therefore, this work proposes a single-channel (C3 or C4) hybrid BCI system that combines motor imagery (MI) and steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) approaches. This study demonstrates that besides MI features, SSVEP features can also be captured from C3 or C4 channel. The results show that due to rich feature information (MI and SSVEP) at these channels, the proposed hybrid BCI system outperforms both MI- and SSVEP-based systems having an average classification accuracy of 85.6 ± 7.7% in a two-class task. ? 2017 Li-Wei Ko et al.",,"Bioelectric potentials; Classification (of information); Interfaces (computer); Classification accuracy; Classification methods; Feature extraction algorithms; Motor imagery; Multiple channels; Record information; Single channels; Steady state visually evoked potentials; Brain computer interface; brain computer interface; classification; electroencephalogram; imagery; steady state; visual evoked potential; brain computer interface; computer interface; electroencephalography; female; human; male; normal human; task performance; visual evoked potential; young adult; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Task Performance and Analysis; User-Computer Interface; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85028361282

Despite many studies utilizing X-ray crystallography, solid-state NMR, and other methods, intermolecular interactions governing the fibril formation remain largely unclear. Here, we used low-frequency Raman (LFR) spectroscopy to investigate the intermolecular β-sheet structure of a core fragment of β2-microglobulin amyloid fibrils, β2m21-29, in aqueous buffer solutions. The LFR spectra (approximately 10-200 cm-1) of β2m21-29 amyloid fibrils measured at different pH values (ranging from 6.8 to 8.0) revealed a broad-spectral pattern with a maximum at ?80 cm-1 below pH 7.2 and at ?110 cm-1 above pH 7.4. This observation is attributed to a pH-dependent structural change from an antiparallel to a parallel intermolecular β-sheet structure. Multivariate curve resolution-alternating least-squares (MCR- ALS) analysis enabled us to decompose the apparently monotonous LFR spectra into three distinctly different contributions: Intermolecular vibrations of the parallel and antiparallel β-sheets and intramolecular vibrations of the peptide backbone. Peak positions of the obtained LFR bands not only exhibit a much more pronounced difference between the two β-sheets than the conventional amide I band, but they also suggest stronger intermolecular interaction, due presumably to the hydrophobic effect, in the parallel β-sheet than in the antiparallel β-sheet. The present results show that LFR spectroscopy in combination with the MCR-ALS analysis holds promise for real-time tracking of the intermolecular dynamics of amyloid fibril formation under physiological conditions. ? 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Crystallography; Glycoproteins; Hydrophobicity; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Peptides; Proteins; Spectrum analysis; Vibration analysis; Amyloid fibril formation; Aqueous buffer solution; Intermolecular dynamics; Intermolecular interactions; Intermolecular vibrations; Intramolecular vibration; Low-frequency Raman spectroscopy; Multivariate curve resolution alternating least-squares; X ray crystallography; amyloid; beta 2 microglobulin; chemistry; human; least square analysis; multivariate analysis; protein conformation; Raman spectrometry; Amyloid; beta 2-Microglobulin; Humans; Least-Squares Analysis; Multivariate Analysis; Protein Conformation; Spectrum Analysis, Raman",2-s2.0-85027362931

The characteristics of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases in the 2 years was analyzed. We conducted a retrospective chart review to analyze the clinical and laboratory features of 206 adult patients with DHF in southern Taiwan in 2014 and 2015. The mortality rate of DHF cases in 2015 was higher than that of cases in 2014 (38.7% versus 12.4%, P < 0.0001). Compared with cases in 2014, DHF cases in 2015 had more complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding (78.5% versus 61.9%, P = 0.01), severe hepatitis (30.1% versus 8%, P < 0.0001), and myocarditis (14% versus 0.9%, P < 0.0001). Among the mortality cases, diabetes, chronic renal failure, proton-pump inhibitors using, platelet transfusion, and Charlson comorbidity index score (Charlson score) were also higher in 2015.

Because AOM is well-known as an important precursor to disinfection byproducts (DBPs) in drinking water, algal eutrophication poses severe concerns for public health. This study aimed to characterize the chemical properties of AOM from two major origins, i.e. extra- (EOM) and intra-cellular organic matter (IOM), of a commonly found green alga Chlorella sp. as precursors to trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). Particularly, the corresponding relation between the chemical functional structure of EOM and IOM and their THM and HAA formation potential (THMFP and HAAFP) was comprehensively investigated. Results show that IOM chiefly comprised of aromatic and other aliphatic protein-like materials (high organic nitrogen content) those have high activity for chlorine substitution (high UV253/UV203 value) due to the high hydroxyl and amide contents in its chemical structures. EOM alternatively exhibited the characteristics of humic- and fulvic-like materials accompanying with high DOC/DON ratio and aromaticity. However, the chemical structure of EOM had a low tendency for chlorine substitution (low UV253/UV203 value); it was also accompanied by a considerable content of carboxylic moisture, which likely resulted in an unfavorable substitution reaction of EOM with chlorine. As a result, the carbonaceous DBP formation potential (C-DBPFP) showed that IOM yielded higher levels of both THMFP and HAAFP than that yielded by EOM. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Algogenic organic matter; Disinfection byproducts; Eutrophication; Green algae,Algae; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Chlorine; Disinfection; Eutrophication; Organic compounds; Potable water; Reservoirs (water); Structure (composition); Substitution reactions; Corresponding relations; Disinfection by-product; Disinfection byproducts; Formation potential; Functional structure; Green alga; Haloacetic acids; Trihalomethanes; Byproducts,2-s2.0-85025149331

This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for nasal and oral S. aureus and MRSA colonization among contemporary HIV-infected populations. Clinical variables for S. aureus and MRSA colonization among HIV-infected outpatients from three hospitals were analyzed and compared with those for oral Candida colonization. Genetic characteristics of MRSA isolates were analyzed. A total of 714 patients were screened for nasal S. aureus colonization, and a subset of 457 patients were also screened for oral S. aureus colonization. Of all patients, 79.4% were receiving HAART, and their mean CD4 count was 472 cells/mm3. The colonization rates in the oral cavity, nasal cavity, and at either site were 18.8%, 31.7%, and 36.8%, respectively, for S. aureus, and 3.1%, 4.4%, and 5.5%, respectively, for MRSA. These rates were all much lower than the previously reported rate of oral Candida colonization (52.4%). By multivariate analysis, a suppressed viral load (&lt;200 copies/mL) protected against oral S. aureus, MRSA, and Candida colonization, and recent use of antibacterial agents protected against oral and nasal S. aureus colonization. Recent incarceration increased the risk of nasal MRSA colonization, while recent hospitalization, tuberculosis, older age, and intravenous drug use increased the risk of oral Candida colonization. Candida spp. did not augment S. aureus or MRSA colonization in the oral cavity. Most of the 41 MRSA isolates recovered belonged to the SCCmec IV/pvl-negative (51.2%) and VT/pvl-positive (26.8%) ST59 local prevalent CA-MRSA clones.

Reconstructing the basic communication function is an important issue for these patients after total laryngectomy surgery. Recently, the image processing technique for lip-reading recognition has been widely developed and applied in various kinds of applications. It is also one of the possibly alternative approaches to reconstructing the basic communication function for these patients after total laryngectomy surgery. Although many human lip-reading recognition methods have been developed to detect lip contour precisely, detecting pronouncing lip contour effectively is still a difficult challenge. In this paper, a novel lip-reading recognition algorithm was proposed to recognize English vowels from the lip contour when speaking. Here, several criteria for detecting the mouth region of interest (ROI) were designed to reduce the error rate of detecting the mouth ROI and lip contour. Moreover, several lip parameters, including the width, height, contour points, area, and the ratio (width/height) of lips, were used to recognize the lip contour and English vowels when speaking. The advantages of the proposed method are that it could detect the mouth ROI automatically, reduce the influence of individual differences, such as the individual lip shape or makeup effect, and it also could perform a good performance without pretraining. Finally, the performance of lip-reading recognition under different backgrounds and individual differences was also tested, and the accuracy of the proposed algorithm on lip-reading recognition was over 80%. ? 2013 IEEE.",Laryngectomy; lip-reading recognition; mouth region of interest; visual-only speech recognition; vowels recognition,Image processing; Image segmentation; Linguistics; Patient rehabilitation; Patient treatment; Surgery; Communication functions; Hypopharyngeal cancer; Image processing technique; Individual Differences; Laryngectomy; Lip reading; Region of interest; vowels recognition; Speech recognition,2-s2.0-85018491120

In this work, we developed a series of F127-gelatin composite hydrogels with reverse thermo-responsive properties. The stiffness of F127-gelatin hydrogels can be adjusted by varying the types and contents of gelatin (type A, GA and type B, GB). The results of rheological data showed that F127-GA gels have higher gel strengths than those of F127-GB, which might be due to different isoelectric points between GA and GB. In addition, F127-gelatin gels showed significant cell viability and biocompatibility for human mesenchymal stem cells, indicating that these discovered hydrogels can serve as potential biomaterials and implantable scaffolds for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. ?

Materials and Methods: MR images of 45 GBM patients (29 males, 16 females) were downloaded from The Cancer Imaging Archive, in which post-contrast T1-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MR sequences were used. Two raters independently segmented the tumors using two semi-automated segmentation tools (TumorPrism3D and 3D Slicer). Regions of interest corresponding to contrast-enhancing lesion, necrotic portions, and non-enhancing T2 high signal intensity component were segmented for each tumor. A total of 180 imaging features were extracted, and their quality was evaluated in terms of stability, normalized dynamic range (NDR), and redundancy, using intra-class correlation coefficients, cluster consensus, and Rand Statistic. Results: Our study results showed that most of the radiomic features in GBM were highly stable. Over 90% of 180 features showed good stability (intra-class correlation coefficient [ICC] ? 0.8), whereas only 7 features were of poor stability (ICC < 0.5). Most first order statistics and morphometric features showed moderate-to-high NDR (4 > NDR ?1), while above 35% of the texture features showed poor NDR (< 1). Features were shown to cluster into only 5 groups, indicating that they were highly redundant. Conclusion: The use of semi-automated software tools provided sufficiently reliable tumor segmentation and feature stability; thus helping to overcome the inherent inter-rater and intra-rater variability of user intervention. However, certain aspects of feature quality, including NDR and redundancy, need to be assessed for determination of representative signature features before further development of radiomics. ? 2017 The Korean Society of Radiology.",Feature quality; Glioblastoma multiforme; Radiomics; Semi-automated segmentation; The Cancer Genome Atlas; The Cancer Imaging Archive,"accuracy; adult; aged; Article; clinical article; female; glioblastoma; human; human tissue; male; morphometry; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phenotype; redundancy analysis; reliability; tumor volume; automation; diagnostic imaging; glioblastoma; image processing; middle aged; pathology; software; Adult; Aged; Automation; Female; Glioblastoma; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Software",2-s2.0-85017519469

The impact of stenting procedures on patient functional capabilities has not yet been explored. The primary aim of this study was to examine associations between periprocedural carotid sonography parameters and post-treatment functional capabilities in stroke patients. Sixty-seven patients who received carotid stenting at 1 angiography laboratory were included. Prestenting and poststenting carotid duplex data were recorded and resistance index (RI) differences at various carotid system locations were compared. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used to assess functional capability. All of the studied parameters were analyzed by SPSS (version 16.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Following stenting, mRS scores improved (n=44) or remained stationary (n=23). Net contralateral internal carotid artery (ICA) RI for patients with improved mRS was lower compared to that for patients with stationary mRS (median=0.040 vs 0.11; P=0.003). The contralateral common carotid artery RI before and after stenting differed significantly (P<0.050) in both. The ipsilateral ICA RI differed (P<0.050) only in patients with improved mRS. The difference in mean transit time, Barthel index, net ipsilateral ICA RI, net contralateral external carotid artery RI, postipsilateral common carotid artery RI, and postipsilateral ICA RI differed significantly between different baseline stroke severity groups (P<0.050). Carotid artery stenting improved physical function in a proportion of ischemic stroke patients with carotid stenosis. Carotid ultrasound is a useful assessment tool to predict likely functional outcomes following carotid artery stenting. ? Copyright 2017 the Author(s).

Among all the indicators of health state in human, heart rate (HR) is one of the most cardinal indicators. The commonly used HR measurement is contact-type, might result in driver’s distraction and discomfort in the vehicle applications. To cope with this problem, remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is utilized to monitor HR at a distance via a web camera. Nevertheless, the rPPG is not without its flaw. The main concern of the rPPG technique is the potential not-robustness result from the arbitrary motion. Consequently, the contribution of this paper is to conquer the motion noise when the car is driving and the driver’s health state is well monitored to enhance the public safety. The proposed algorithm is investigated in not only the indoor environment but as well the outdoor driving, which contains much more unpredictable motion. With k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier on chrominance-based features, the mean square error can be reduced from 30.6 to 2.79 bpm, approaching the medical instrument level.

Progressive intracellular accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) is considered to be patho-genically responsible for the phenotype variability of FD that causes cardiovascular dysfunction; however, molecular mechanisms underlying the impairment of FD-associated cardiovascular tissues remain unclear. In this study, we reprogrammed human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from peripheral blood cells of patients with FD (FD-iPSCs); subsequently differentiated them into vascular endothelial-like cells (FD-ECs) expressing CD31, VE-cadherin, and vWF; and investigated their ability to form vascular tube-like structures. FD-ECs recapitulated the FD pathophysiological phenotype exhibiting intracellular Gb3 accumulation under a transmission electron microscope. Moreover, compared with healthy control iPSC-derived endothelial cells (NC-ECs), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production considerably increased in FD-ECs. Microarray analysis was performed to explore the possible mechanism underlying Gb3 accumulation-induced ROS production in FD-ECs. Our results revealed that superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), a mitochondrial antioxidant, was significantly downregulated in FD-ECs. Compared with NC-ECs, AMPK activity was significantly enhanced in FD-ECs. Furthermore, to investigate the role of Gb3 in these effects, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with Gb3. After Gb3 treatment, we observed that SOD2 expression was suppressed and AMPK activity was enhanced in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, our results indicate that excess accumulation of Gb3 suppressed SOD2 expression, increased ROS production, enhanced AMPK activation, and finally caused vascular endothelial dysfunction. Our findings suggest that dysregulated mitochondrial ROS may be a potential target for treating FD. ? 2017 Cognizant, LLC.",Fabry disease (FD); Gb3 accumulation; Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs); Superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2); Vascular endothelial dysfunction,"adenylate kinase; CD31 antigen; globotriaosylceramide; manganese superoxide dismutase; reactive oxygen metabolite; vascular endothelial cadherin; von Willebrand factor; antioxidant; manganese superoxide dismutase; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide dismutase; Article; cell reprogramming technique; cell structure; controlled study; down regulation; enzyme activity; Fabry disease; human; human cell; induced pluripotent stem cell; microarray analysis; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; umbilical vein endothelial cell; vascular endothelial cell; cell culture; endothelium cell; Fabry disease; induced pluripotent stem cell; metabolism; pathology; Antioxidants; Cells, Cultured; Endothelial Cells; Fabry Disease; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Reactive Oxygen Species; Superoxide Dismutase",2-s2.0-85014785322

In this paper, a novel numerical approach to the design of the healing chamber for additive-manufactured dental implants is proposed. This study developed an algorithm for the modeling of bone growth and employed finite element method in ANSYS to facilitate the design of healing chambers with a highly complex configuration. The model was then applied to the design of dental implants for insertion into the posterior maxillary bones. Two types of ITI? solid cylindrical screwed implant with extra rectangular-shaped healing chamber as an initial design are adopted, with which to evaluate the proposed system. This resulted in several configurations for the healing chamber, which were then evaluated based on the corresponding volume fraction of healthy surrounding bone. The best of these implants resulted in a healing chamber surrounded by around 9.2% more healthy bone than that obtained from the original design. The optimal design increased the contact area between the bone and implant by around 52.9%, which is expected to have a significant effect on osseointegration. The proposed approach is highly efficient which typically completes the optimization of each implant within 3-5 days on an ordinary personal computer.

Antibodies against 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) have recently been associated with immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, especially in patients with statin exposure. As the data are very limited concerning phenotypes and treatment in paediatric patients, we aimed to identify the paediatric patients positive for anti-HMGCR antibodies and clarify their features and therapeutic strategies. Methods. We screened 62 paediatric patients who were clinically and/or pathologically suspected to have inflammatory myopathy for anti-HMGCR antibodies. We further re-assessed the clinical and histological findings and the treatment of the patients positive for anti-HMGCR antibodies. Results. We identified nine paediatric patients with anti-HMGCR antibodies (15%). This was more frequent than anti-signal recognition particle antibodies (four patients, 6%) in our cohort. The onset age ranged from infancy to 13 years. Five patients were initially diagnosed with muscular dystrophy, including congenital muscular dystrophy. Most patients responded to high-dose corticosteroid therapy first but often needed adjuvant immunosuppressants to become stably controlled. Conclusion.Paediatric necrotizing myopathy associated with anti-HMGCR antibodies may not be very rare. Phenotypes are similar to those of adult patients, but a chronic slowly progressive course may be more frequent. Some patients share the clinicopathological features of muscular dystrophy indicating that recognizing inflammatory aetiology would be challenging without autoantibody information. On the other hand, most patients responded to treatment, especially those who were diagnosed early. Our results suggest the importance of early autoantibody testing in paediatric patients who have manifestations apparently compatible with muscular dystrophy in addition to those who have typical features of inflammatory myopathy. ?

At least some Aβ neurotoxicity is caused by the presence of excess glutamate that has been induced by Aβ accumulation. Memantine is currently the only NMDA receptor inhibitor approved for treating moderate-to-severe AD patients. We utilized primary cortical neurons and DiBAC4(3), a slow-response voltage sensitive fluorescence dye, to create a novel system for screening herbal medicines that allows the identification of pure compounds able to ameliorate Aβ-induced abnormal depolarization. The intensity of DiBAC4(3) fluorescence was increased when primary neurons were stimulated by Aβ; furthermore, pre-treatment with memantine abolished this change. Using this system, we identified six crude extracts made from herbal medicines that effectively alleviated this Aβ-induced abnormal depolarization. Among these herbal medicines, one pure compound, baicalein, which was known to be present in Scutellaria baricalensis and is known to improve memory using an AD mouse model, was identified by our assay. However, the compound's molecular mechanism remained unknown. We found that baicalein, in addition to inhibiting Aβ-induced depolarization, possibly functions as an antagonist of AMPA and NMDA receptors.

Previously, we reported an explosive outbreak of HIV-1 circulating recombinant form (CRF) 07-BC among injection drug users (IDUs) in Taiwan in 2004. The goal of this study was to characterize the DR of CRF07-BC strains using different assays including UDPS. Seven CRF07-BC isolates including 4 from early epidemic (collected in 2004-2005) and 3 from late epidemic (collected in 2008) were obtained from treatment-na?ve patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Viral RNA was extracted directly from patient's plasma or from cultural supernatant and the pol sequences were determined using RT-PCR sequencing or UDPS. For comparison, phenotypic drug susceptibility assay using MAGIC-5 cells (in-house phenotypic assay) and Antivirogram were performed. In-house phenotypic assay showed that all the early epidemic and none of the late epidemic CRF07-BC isolates were resistant to most protease inhibitors (PIs) (4.4-47.3 fold). Neither genotypic assay nor Antivirogram detected any DR mutations. UDPS showed that early epidemic isolates contained 0.01-0.08% of PI DR major mutations. Furthermore, the combinations of major and accessory PI DR mutations significantly correlated with the phenotypic DR. The in-house phenotypic assay is superior to other conventional phenotypic assays in the detection of DR variants with a frequency as low as 0.01%. ? 2017 Huang et al.

Objective The purpose of this study was to develop a method for simultaneous noninvasive recording of skin sympathetic nerve activity (SKNA) and electrocardiogram (ECG) using conventional ECG electrodes. This method (neuECG) can be used to adequately estimate sympathetic tone. Methods We recorded neuECG signals from the skin of 56 human subjects. The signals were low-pass filtered to show the ECG and high-pass filtered to show nerve activity. Protocol 1 included 12 healthy volunteers who underwent cold water pressor test and Valsalva maneuver. Protocol 2 included 19 inpatients with epilepsy but without known heart diseases monitored for 24 hours. Protocol 3 included 22 patients admitted with electrical storm and monitored for 39.0 ± 28.2 hours. Protocol 4 included 3 patients who underwent bilateral stellate ganglion blockade with lidocaine injection. Results In patients without heart diseases, spontaneous nerve discharges were frequently observed at baseline and were associated with heart rate acceleration. SKNA recorded from chest leads (V1–V6) during cold water pressor test and Valsalva maneuver (protocol 1) was invariably higher than during baseline and recovery periods (P &lt;.001). In protocol 2, the average SKNA correlated with heart rate acceleration (r = 0.73 ± 0.14, P &lt;.05) and shortening of QT interval (P &lt;.001). Among 146 spontaneous ventricular tachycardia episodes recorded in 9 patients of protocol 3, 106 episodes (73%) were preceded by SKNA within 30 seconds of onset. Protocol 4 showed that bilateral stellate ganglia blockade by lidocaine inhibited SKNA. Conclusion SKNA is detectable using conventional ECG electrodes in humans and may be useful in estimating sympathetic tone. ? 2016 Heart Rhythm Society",Cold water pressor test; Microneurography; Sympathetic nerve activity; Ventricular tachycardia,"lidocaine; adult; Article; clinical article; cold pressor test; cold water pressor test; electrocardiogram; epilepsy; female; heart right ventricle dysplasia; heart ventricle tachycardia; human; ischemic cardiomyopathy; male; mean arterial pressure; middle aged; nerve conduction; non invasive procedure; priority journal; QT interval; signal noise ratio; skin sympathetic nerve activity; sympathetic tone; Valsalva maneuver; adrenergic system; aged; case control study; comparative study; devices; electrocardiography; electrode; heart rate; heart ventricle tachycardia; innervation; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; reference value; skin; stellate ganglion; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Electrocardiography; Electrodes; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Reference Values; Skin; Stellate Ganglion; Sympathetic Nervous System; Tachycardia, Ventricular",2-s2.0-85006513287

The complexities involved in the subjective experience of pain make it difficult to obtain a quantitative assessment from the induced spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity of high dimensionality. Most previous studies have investigated the perception of pain by analyzing the amplitude or spatial patterns in the response of the brain to external stimulation. This study investigated the decoding of endogenous pain perceptions according to resting-state magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings. In our experiments, we applied a beamforming method to calculate the brain activity for every brain region and examined temporal and spectral features of brain activity for predicting the intensity of perceived pain in patients with primary dysmenorrhea undergoing menstrual pain. Our results show that the asymmetric index of sample entropy in the precuneus and the sample entropy in the left posterior cingulate gyrus were the most informative characteristics associated with the perception of menstrual pain. The correlation coefficient (ρ=0.64, p<0.001) between the predicted and self-reported pain scores demonstrated the high prediction accuracy. In addition to the estimated brain activity, we were able to predict accurate pain scores directly from MEG channel signals (ρ=0.65, p<0.001). These findings suggest the possibility of using the proposed model based on resting-state MEG to predict the perceived intensity of endogenous pain. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Decoding; Endogenous pain; Pain perception; Resting-state MEG,"accuracy; adult; Article; brain asymmetry; brain region; clinical article; controlled study; disease severity; dysmenorrhea; electroencephalogram; emotionality; entropy; female; hemispheric dominance; human; magnetoencephalography; nociception; pain assessment; pain intensity; posterior cingulate; precuneus; prediction; priority journal; brain; magnetoencephalography; nociception; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; signal processing; young adult; Adult; Brain; Dysmenorrhea; Entropy; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Magnetoencephalography; Pain Perception; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85005914692

However, evidence is needed regarding the profiles of the thalamocortical network in patients with secondarily generalized seizures from focal neocortical sources. We used high-resolution T1-weighted, diffusion-tensor and resting-state functional MR imaging (rs-fMRI) to examine 16 patients with secondarily generalized extratemporal lobe seizures and 16 healthy controls. All the patients were medically effective and MRI-negative. Using whole brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to compare the patients with the normal controls, we observed significantly decreased gray matter (GM) density in the thalamus and 3 frontal gyri and significantly reduced white matter (WM) fractional anisotropy (FA) in the bilateral anterior corona radiata of the patients. Alterations in the thalamocortical functional connectivity with different cortices were identified by the rs-fMRI analysis seeding of the whole thalamus. The prefrontal gyri with the greatest functional connectivity were also traced by seeding a sub-thalamic region that is demarcated in an atlas, in which the thalamic parcellation is based on the WM connectivity to the cortices. This sub-thalamic region anatomically contains the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus where, concordantly, there was a significant decrease in thalamic GM density in the VBM study. In contrast to the negative correlation between the disease duration and reduced thalamic densities and subcortical FA values, the strength of the functional thalamocortical connectivity had a paradoxical correlation. Our results conclusively indicate that generalized seizures with a focal cortical source are associated with structural and functional alterations in the thalamocortical network. ? 2016 The Authors",Fractional anisotropy; Generalized seizure; Gray matter density; Thalamocortical network,"adult; Article; brain mapping; brain region; clinical article; complex partial seizure; controlled study; correlation analysis; diffusion tensor imaging; disease duration; electroencephalogram; female; fractional anisotropy; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; gray matter; human; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; resting state network; retrospective study; simple partial seizure; thalamocortical tract; thalamus; tonic clonic seizure; voxel based morphometry; white matter; young adult; brain cortex; complication; connectome; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; focal epilepsy; generalized epilepsy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; pathophysiology; procedures; thalamus; Adult; Cerebral Cortex; Connectome; Disease Progression; Epilepsies, Partial; Epilepsy, Generalized; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Thalamus; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84999048323

However, the effectiveness of these cleaning approaches and dynamic changes of surface microbiota upon cleaning remain unclear. Here, we report the surface changes of bacterial communities with terminal disinfection and daily cleaning in a medical intensive care unit (MICU) and only terminal disinfection in a respiratory care center (RCC) using 16s ribosomal RNA (rRNA) metagenomics. A total of 36 samples, including 9 samples per sampling time, from each ward were analysed. The clinical isolates were recorded during the sampling time. A large amount of microbial diversity was detected, and human skin microbiota (HSM) was predominant in both wards. In addition, the colonization rate of the HSM in the MICU was higher than that in the RCC, especially for Moraxellaceae. A higher alpha-diversity (p?=?0.005519) and a lower UniFrac distance was shown in the RCC due to the lack of daily cleaning. Moreover, a significantly higher abundance among Acinetobacter sp., Streptococcus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. was shown in the RCC compared to the MICU using the paired t test.

However, in silico methods for predicting BY-kinases have not been developed yet. Since these enzymes are involved in key regulatory processes, and are promising targets for anti-bacterial drug design, it is desirable to develop a simple and easily interpretable predictor to gain new insights into bacterial tyrosine phosphorylation. This study proposes a novel SCMBYK method for predicting and characterizing BY-kinases. Results: A dataset consisting of 797 BY-kinases and 783 non-BY-kinases was established to design the SCMBYK predictor, which achieved training and test accuracies of 97.55 and 96.73%, respectively. Furthermore, the leave-one-phylum-out method was used to predict specific bacterial phyla hosts of target sequences, gaining 97.39% average test accuracy. After analyzing SCMBYK-derived propensity scores, four characteristics of BY-kinases were determined: 1) BY-kinases tend to be composed of aα-helices; 2) the amino-acid content of extracellular regions of BY-kinases is expected to be dominated by residues such as Val, Ile, Phe and Tyr; 3) BY-kinases structurally resemble nuclear proteins; 4) different domains play different roles in triggering BY-kinase activity. Conclusions: The SCMBYK predictor is an effective method for identification of possible BY-kinases. Furthermore, it can be used as a part of a novel drug repurposing method, which recognizes putative BY-kinases and matches them to approved drugs. Among other results, our analysis revealed that azathioprine could suppress the virulence of M. tuberculosis, and thus be considered as a potential antibiotic for tuberculosis treatment. ? 2016 The Author(s).",BY-kinase; Dipeptide; Drug repurposing; Propensity scores; Scoring card method,"Amino acids; Forecasting; Peptides; Statistical tests; BY-kinase; Di-peptides; Propensity score; Repurposing; Scoring card method; Enzymes; bacterial protein; dipeptide; protein tyrosine kinase; tyrosine; bacterium; chemistry; enzymology; propensity score; protein database; software; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Databases, Protein; Dipeptides; Propensity Score; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Software; Tyrosine",2-s2.0-85006906001

Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been extensively used with the aim of developing accurate molecular therapies, because of their emerging role in the regulation of cancer-related genes. This work aims to identify the miRNA signatures related to survival of GBM patients for developing molecular therapies. Results: This work proposes a support vector regression (SVR)-based estimator, called SVR-GBM, to estimate the survival time in patients with GBM using their miRNA expression profiles. SVR-GBM identified 24 out of 470 miRNAs that were significantly associated with survival of GBM patients. SVR-GBM had a mean absolute error of 0.63years and a correlation coefficient of 0.76 between the real and predicted survival time. The 10 top-ranked miRNAs according to prediction contribution are as follows: hsa-miR-222, hsa-miR-345, hsa-miR-587, hsa-miR-526a, hsa-miR-335, hsa-miR-122, hsa-miR-24, hsa-miR-433, hsa-miR-574 and hsa-miR-320.

Cisplatin has been proved as chemotherapy drug for advanced human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a key enzyme in the pyrimidine salvage pathway, and increased expression of TS is thought to be associated with resistance to cisplatin. In this study, we showed that salinomycin (0.5–2?μg/mL) treatment down-regulating of TS expression in an AKT inactivation manner in two NSCLC cell lines, human lung adenocarcinoma A549 and squamous cell carcinoma H1703 cells. Knockdown of TS using small interfering RNA (siRNA) or inhibiting AKT activity with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 enhanced the cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition of salinomycin. A combination of cisplatin and salinomycin resulted in synergistic enhancement of cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition in NSCLC cells, accompanied with reduced activation of phospho-AKT, and TS expression. Overexpression of a constitutive active AKT (AKT-CA) expression vector reversed the salinomycin and cisplatin-induced synergistic cytotoxicity. In contrast, pretreatment with LY294002 further decreased the cell viability in salinomycin and cisplatin cotreated cells. Our findings suggested that the down-regulation of AKT-mediated TS expression by salinomycin enhanced the cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells. These results may provide a rationale to combine salinomycin with cisplatin for lung cancer treatment. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",AKT; Cisplatin; Non-small cell lung cancer; Salinomycin; Thymidylate synthase,"2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone; cisplatin; messenger RNA; protein kinase B; salinomycin; small interfering RNA; thymidylate synthase; antiinfective agent; antineoplastic agent; cisplatin; messenger RNA; protein kinase B; pyran derivative; salinomycin; thymidylate synthase; A549 cell line; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; Article; cancer cell; cell growth; cell survival; cell viability; controlled study; down regulation; drug cytotoxicity; drug potentiation; enzyme activity; enzyme inactivation; expression vector; gene overexpression; gene silencing; genetic transfection; H1703 cell line; human; human cell; lung adenocarcinoma; lung cancer cell line; priority journal; protein expression; protein stability; real time polymerase chain reaction; squamous cell lung carcinoma; Western blotting; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; combination drug therapy; genetics; metabolism; tumor cell line; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Cisplatin; Down-Regulation; Drug Therapy, Combination; Humans; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Pyrans; RNA, Messenger; Thymidylate Synthase",2-s2.0-84997190931

The etiology of FADS is heterogeneous, and the majority remains unknown. Prenatal diagnosis of FADS because of neuromuscular origin has relied on clinical features and fetal muscle pathology, which can be unrevealing. The recent advance of next-generation sequencing (NGS) can provide definitive molecular diagnosis effectively. Methods and Results: An 18-week-old fetus presented with akinesia and multiple contractures of joints. The mother had two previously aborted similarly affected fetuses. Clinical diagnosis of FADS was made. Molecular diagnosis using cord blood by NGS of genes related to neuromuscular diseases revealed two compound heterozygous mutations; c.602G > A(p.W201*) and c.1516A > C(p.T506P), in the Kelch-like 40 (KLHL40) gene. Based on this information, prenatal diagnosis was performed on the CVS of the subsequent pregnancy that resulted in an unaffected female baby, heterozygous for the c.1516A > C(p.T506P) mutation. Conclusion: Identification of KLHL40 mutations in one of the aborted fetuses provided a confirmative diagnosis of FADS, facilitating the prenatal diagnosis of the subsequent pregnancy.

The regulatory mechanisms of atrial myocyte hypertrophy of MR patients remain unknown. Methods and Results This study comprised 14 patients with MR, 7 patients with aortic valve disease (AVD), and 6 purchased samples from normal subjects (NC). We used microarrays, enrichment analysis and quantitative RT-PCR to study the gene expression profiles in the left atria. Microarray results showed that 112 genes were differentially up-regulated and 132 genes were differentially down-regulated in the left atria between MR patients and NC. Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes demonstrated that ""NFAT in cardiac hypertrophy"" pathway was not only one of the significant associated canonical pathways, but also the only one predicted with a non-zero score of 1.34 (i.e. activated) through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis molecule activity predictor. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Global Molecular Network analysis exhibited that the highest score network also showed high association with cardiac related pathways and functions. Therefore, 5 NFAT associated genes (PPP3R1, PPP3CB, CAMK1, MEF2C, PLCE1) were studies for validation. The mRNA expressions of PPP3CB and MEF2C were significantly up-regulated, and CAMK1 and PPP3R1 were significantly down-regulated in MR patients compared to NC. Moreover, MR patients had significantly increased mRNA levels of PPP3CB, MEF2C and PLCE1 compared to AVD patients. The atrial myocyte size of MR patients significantly exceeded that of the AVD patients and NC. Conclusions Differentially expressed genes in the ""NFAT in cardiac hypertrophy"" pathway may play a critical role in the atrial myocyte hypertrophy of MR patients. ? 2016 Chang et al.

Many lines of evidence suggest that deletions occurring in HBV genomic DNA are highly associated with the activity of HBV via the interplay between aberrant viral proteins release and human immune system. Deletions finding on the HBV whole genome sequences is thus a very important issue though there exist underlying the challenges in mining such big and complex biological data. Although some next generation sequencing (NGS) tools are recently designed for identifying structural variations such as insertions or deletions, their validity is generally committed to human sequences study. This design may not be suitable for viruses due to different species. We propose a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based data mining method called DeF-GPU to efficiently and precisely identify HBV deletions from large NGS data, which generally contain millions of reads. To fit the single instruction multiple data instructions, sequencing reads are referred to as multiple data and the deletion finding procedure is referred to as a single instruction. We use Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) to parallelize the procedures, and further validate DeF-GPU on 5 synthetic and 1 real datasets. Our results suggest that DeF-GPU outperforms the existing commonly-used method Pindel and is able to exactly identify the deletions of our ground truth in few seconds.

The average lifetime of the NADH and FAD autofluorescence was shorter in cancer cells than in normal cells, indicating that the difference in metabolism between healthy and cancer cells alters the conditions for coenzymes such as NADH and FAD and that the autofluorescence lifetime measurement of NADH and FAD is applicable for the noninvasive diagnosis of cancer cells.

These results as well as the fluorescence lifetime images of exogenous fluorophores stained with sodium pheophorbide a in normal and cancer cells suggest that the difference in the fluorescence lifetime between normal and cancer cells cannot be attributed to a difference in the intracellular pH or refractive index but to the difference in the bound condition between proteins and NADH or FAD under the different intracellular environments of normal and cancer cells. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Autofluorescence; Cancer cell; FAD; FLIM; NADH; Normal cell,flavine adenine nucleotide; photosensitizing agent; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; Article; autofluorescence imaging; autouorescence lifetime imaging; cancer cell; cancer diagnosis; cell membrane; cell pH; cell population; conformation; electron transport; environment; female; HeLa cell line; human; human cell; intracellular environment; intracellular space; mitochondrion; nonhuman; photodynamic therapy; priority journal; protein structure; refraction index; yeast cell; animal; fluorescence; neoplasm; pathology; rat; Animals; Fluorescence; Neoplasms; Rats,2-s2.0-84995468207

However, despite numerous epidemiological studies, no consensus has been reached regarding the relationship between statin use and breast cancer risk. Methods: This retrospective case–control study enrolled 4332 breast cancer patients and 21,660 age-matched controls registered in the National Health Insurance program of Taiwan, which covers approximately 99% of the population. The study cases were women for whom a diagnosis of breast cancer (ICD-9-CM code 174.X) had been recorded in LHID2005 between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2010. A logistic regression model was adjusted for potential confounding factors, including the level of urbanization, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index was applied to assess potential comorbidities. We also considered possible bias caused by random urbanization, because nutrition and lifestyle factors are related to breast cancer incidence. Results: Our results showed that lovastatin was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer (adjusted OR 0.596; 95% CI 0.497–0.714; p?<?0.001), and atorvastatin exhibited a protective tendency against breast cancer (adjusted OR 0.887; 95% CI 0.776–1.013; p?<?0.077). Conclusions: Although no consensus has been established regarding the relationship between statin use and breast cancer risk, our study indicated that lovastatin is a potential chemopreventive agent against breast cancer.

HHIS Zen practice involves specific neurocardiac-cardiorespiratory interaction while on the way of realizing the heart-dominant, detached brain. Results of analyzing the electrocardiogram and respiratory signals of 10 experienced practitioners reveal several distinctive characteristics: (1) remarkably linear correlation between standard deviation of the normal R-to-R intervals, SDNN, and total power in very-low-frequency (VLF, 0.0033-0.04Hz) band of power spectrum of the heart-rate sequence, (2) time-varying VLF power dominating over the low-frequency and high-frequency power in heart rate variability (HRV) variations, (3) intermittent transition into slowly, deeply abdominal respiration inducing a boost of heart rates, (4) heart-rate baseline slowly fluctuating at 0.005-0.0067Hz, about 1.5-2 cycles in 5-min period, and (5) remarkable respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) synchrony between heart rate and respiration rhythm. This paper proposes a rational scientific hypothesis for the neurocardiac-cardiorespiratory mechanism. The unique scheme of HHIS Zen meditation involves the spiritual-qi concentration and refinement for pinpointing into the particular energy centers, mailuns. Ignition by a subtle, deepest abdominal respiration, electrical impulses rapidly transmit from solar plexus to branchial plexuses to activate unique heart-transition process.

Here self-assembled nanoparticles of amphiphilic carboxymethyl-hexanoyl chitosan (CHC) were shown to present nano-microenvironments enabling simultaneous loading of hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. This was expanded into a dual-drug nano-delivery system to treat lung CSC. CHC nanoparticles were loaded/chemically modified with the anticancer drug cisplatin and the MDR-suppressing Chinese herbal extract demethoxycurcumin, followed by biofunctionalization with CD133 antibody for enhanced uptake by lung CSC, all in a feasible one-pot preparation. The nanoparticles were characterized with regard to chemistry, size, zeta potential and drug loading/release. Biofunctionalized and non-functionalized nanoparticles were investigated for uptake by lung CSC. Subsequently the cytotoxicity of single and dual drugs, free in solution or in nanoparticles, was evaluated against lung CSC at different doses. From the dose response at different concentrations the degree of synergy was determined through Chou-Talalay's Plot. The biofunctionalized nanoparticles promoted synergistic effects between the drugs and were highly effective against MDR lung CSC.

It is of great interest whether resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) is differentiable between these phases. Methods: We compared resting-state EEG energy intensity and effective connectivity in different migraine phases using EEG power and coherence analyses in patients with migraine without aura as compared with healthy controls (HCs). EEG power and isolated effective coherence of delta (1–3.5?Hz), theta (4–7.5?Hz), alpha (8–12.5?Hz), and beta (13–30?Hz) bands were calculated in the frontal, central, temporal, parietal, and occipital regions. Results: Fifty patients with episodic migraine (1–5 headache days/month) and 20 HCs completed the study. Patients were classified into inter-ictal, pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal phases (n = 22, 12, 8, 8, respectively), using 36-h criteria. Compared to HCs, inter-ictal and ictal patients, but not pre- or post-ictal patients, had lower EEG power and coherence, except for a higher effective connectivity in fronto-occipital network in inter-ictal patients (p <.05). Compared to data obtained from the inter-ictal group, EEG power and coherence were increased in the pre-ictal group, with the exception of a lower effective connectivity in fronto-occipital network (p <.05).

To be practical and safe for use in daily life, an important issue is whether these robot walking helpers can be effectively maneuvered and provide guidance to the users. These concerns become even more important for a passive robot walking helper, as it relies mainly on the user's applied forces to move. In this paper, we propose a motion guidance system for a passive robot walking helper. More specifically, we develop a system to identify user's intentions from applied grip forces. This system consists of a pair of force-sensing grips attached to the handles of the robot walking helper and a learning scheme for the mapping between the measured grip forces and the driving force/torque imposed on the helper. The learning scheme, combined with an assistive strategy extended from our previous work, provides motion guidance to the elders during walking. The feasibility of the proposed system is demonstrated via a series of experiments involving motion assistance with i-Go, a passive robot walking helper developed in our laboratory. ? 2016 IEEE.",Grip forces; intention detection; motion guidance and control; passive robot walking helper,Robots; Applied forces; Driving forces; Elderly populations; Force sensing; Learning schemes; Motion guidances; Provide guidances; User's intentions; Walking aids,2-s2.0-84988354519

Imbalanced MMPs/TIMPs are implicated in the vascular alterations of uremic patients on hemodialysis (HD). We have investigated the plasma levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in uremic patients and the effects of a course of HD on the changes in these factors. Methods: There were 382 uremic patients on regular HD treatment and 50 healthy controls enrolled in this study. The plasma MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels were detected by gelatin zymography, and TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 concentrations were determined by ELISA assay. Results: Significantly higher plasma MMP-2 and MMP-9 and decreased TIMP-1 in the uremic patients were detected compared with those in the controls. Therefore, there were markedly higher MMP-2/TIMP-2 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios in the uremic patients. In the course of a single HD session, the plasma MMP-2 level was significantly decreased from pre-HD to post-HD. TIMP-1 concentration was significantly increased from pre-HD to post-HD. Although the HD session did not have a significant effect on the levels of plasma MMP-9 and TIMP-2, both plasma MMP-2/TIMP-2 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios were significantly decreased from pre-HD to post-HD levels. Conclusion: HD session could decrease MMP-2 and increase TIMP-1 level in the circulation of uremic patients. The physiological significance of reduced MMPs/TIMPs ratio due to a single HD session is required to further validate. ? 2015, Japanese Society of Nephrology.",Hemodialysis; Matrix metalloproteinase; Tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase; Uremic patient,"gelatinase A; gelatinase B; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; MMP2 protein, human; MMP9 protein, human; TIMP1 protein, human; TIMP2 protein, human; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2; adult; aged; Article; clinical outcome; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; hemodialysis; human; major clinical study; male; protein blood level; uremia; zymography; blood; middle aged; uremia; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Middle Aged; Renal Dialysis; Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1; Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2; Uremia",2-s2.0-84951975711

Although passive treatment with antitumor antibodies has exhibited remarkable therapeutic efficacy, inhibitory effects on tumor progression by endogenous antitumor autoantibodies (EAAs) have been limited. In this study, we show that P4N, a derivative of the plant lignan nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), enhanced the production of EAAs and inhibited tumor growth at low noncytotoxic concentrations via its immunoregulatory activity. Intratumoral injection of P4N improved the quantity and quality of EAAs, and passive transfer of P4N-induced EAAs dramatically suppressed lung metastasis formation and prolonged the survival of mice inoculated with metastatic CT26 tumor cells. P4N-induced EAAs specifically recognized two surface antigens, 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) and F1F0 ATP synthase, on the plasma membrane of cancer cells. Additionally, P4N treatment led to B-cell proliferation, differentiation to plasma cells, and high titers of autoantibody production. By serial induction of autocrine and paracrine signals in monocytes, P4N increased B-cell proliferation and antibody production via the leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H)/activin A/B-cell activating factor (BAFF) pathway. This mechanism provides a useful platform for studying and seeking a novel immunomodulator that can be applied in targeting therapy by improving the quantity and quality of the EAAs. ? 2016, National Academy of Sciences.

The driving cause of SCD was considered due to lift-threatening arrhythmia where systemic inflammation acts as the pathophysiological basis linking RA to autonomicdysfunction. Methods: To assess the sympathetic over-activity of ""inflammatory reflex"", we measured heart rate variability (HRV) in a rat collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model, whose arthritis is induced in Lewis rats by intradermal injection of emulsion of type II collagen. Single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded for 30 min every two days. Time and frequency-domain parameters, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), deceleration (DC) and acceleration capacity (AC) were analyzed. Results: Compared with 9 control rats, many of HRV parameters of 9 CIA rats revealed significant different. At the beginning of arthritis, LF/HF was significant higher than controls (1st week: 2.41 ± 0.7 vs. 1.76 ± 0.6, p < 0.05; 2nd week: 2.24 ± 0.5 vs. 1.58 ± 0.5, p < 0.05) indicating intensive inflammatory reflex at the initial phase of inflammation but no significant difference was observed in the following recover phase. The similar trend of DFA parameters was noted. However, the DC appeared progressive lower despite of no significant increase of the LF/HF compared with controls since 4th week. Conclusions: We observed sympathetic over-activation of inflammatory reflex during early stage of arthritis in CIA rats. The ongoing decline of DC indicated advanced cardiac autonomic dysfunction regardless of remission of acute arthritis. ? 2016 The Author(s)",Autonomic function; Collagen-induced arthritis; Deceleration capacity; Heart rate variability; Rheumatoid arthritis,"acceleration; adult; animal experiment; animal model; arthritis; Article; autonomic dysfunction; cardiovascular risk; controlled study; deceleration; electrocardiogram; heart arrhythmia; heart rate variability; nonhuman; rat; sympathetic tone; animal; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Autonomic Nervous System Diseases; chemically induced; complication; electrocardiography; experimental arthritis; heart rate; human; Lewis rat; rheumatoid arthritis; risk; collagen type 2; Animals; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Arthritis, Experimental; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Autonomic Nervous System Diseases; Collagen Type II; Electrocardiography; Heart Rate; Humans; Rats; Rats, Inbred Lew; Risk",2-s2.0-84998812225

In this work, we proposed and demonstrated a method that can widely tune the CCTs of electroluminescence (EL) from white-light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) by employing plasmonic filters. These integrated on-chip plasmonic filters are composed of semicontinuous thin Ag film or Ag nanoparticles (NPs) both included in the indium tin oxide anode contact, which have different characteristics of plasmonic resonant absorptions that can tune the EL spectra of white LECs. The CCTs of EL from white LECs integrated with semicontinuous thin Ag film and randomly distributed Ag NPs are 5778 and 2350 K, respectively. A commercially available laser scanning system was used to locally thermal anneal the semicontinuous thin Ag film to form the randomly distributed Ag NPs on the scanned areas. Hence, these two kinds of filters can be integrated on the same chip of white LEC, giving more freedom to control the CCTs of white EL and more potential applications. In addition, the laser scanning system used here is quite often used in display manufactures so that our proposed method can be immediately adopted by the light-emitting diode industry. ? 2016 American Chemical Society.",color temperature; light-emitting electrochemical cells; nanoparticles; plasmonic filter; white light,Color; Electroluminescence; Imaging systems; Indium; Laser applications; Light; Light emitting diodes; Light sources; Nanoparticles; Physiology; Plasmons; Silver; Surface analysis; Tin oxides; Color temperatures; Correlated color temperature; Indium-tin-oxide anodes; Laser scanning systems; Light-emitting electrochemical cell; Plasmonic filters; Solid-state white light; White light; Electrochemical cells,2-s2.0-84999274199

In order to predict the next movement for assistive torque given by exoskeleton to the human, a predictive Artificial Neural Network (pANN) is developed. A prototype lower limb exoskeleton has been designed and constructed for experimental study. The controller is implemented by using LabVIEW programming.

Motor imagery (MI) is one well-known basis for designing Electroencephalography (EEG)-based real-life BCI systems. However, EEG signals are often contaminated with severe noise and various uncertainties, imprecise and incomplete information streams. Therefore, this study proposes spectrum ensemble based on swam-optimized fuzzy integral for integrating decisions from sub-band classifiers that are established by a sub-band common spatial pattern (SBCSP) method. Firstly, the SBCSP effectively extracts features from EEG signals, and thereby the multiple linear discriminant analysis (MLDA) is employed during a MI classification task. Subsequently, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to regulate the subject-specific parameters for assigning optimal confidence levels for classifiers used in the fuzzy integral during the fuzzy fusion stage of the proposed system. Moreover, BCI systems usually tend to have complex architectures, be bulky in size, and require time-consuming processing. To overcome this drawback, a wireless and wearable EEG measurement system is investigated in this study. Finally, in our experimental result, the proposed system is found to produce significant improvement in terms of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a robotic arm can be reliably controlled using the proposed BCI system.

Combining vorinostat with cisplatin may relax the chromatin structure and facilitate the accessibility of cisplatin, thus enhancing its cytotoxicity. Studies have not yet investigated the effects of the combination of vorinostat and cisplatin on small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Methods: We first assessed the efficacy of vorinostat with etoposide/cisplatin (EP; triple combination) and then investigated the effects of cotreatment with vorinostat and cisplatin on H209 and H146 SCLC cell lines. The anticancer effects of various combinations were determined in terms of cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, and vorinostat-regulated proteins. We also evaluated the efficacy of vorinostat/cisplatin combination in H209 xenograft nude mice. Results: Our data revealed that the triple combination engendered a significant reduction of cell viability and high apoptotic cell death. In addition, vorinostat combined with cisplatin enhanced cell growth inhibition, induced apoptosis, and promoted cell cycle arrest. We observed that the acetylation levels of histone H3 and α-tubulin were higher in combination treatments than in vorinostat treatment alone. Moreover, vorinostat reduced the expression of thymidylate synthase (TS), and TS remained inhibited after cotreament with cisplatin. Furthermore, an in vivo study revealed that the combination of vorinostat and cisplatin significantly inhibited tumor growth in xenograft nude mice (tumor growth inhibition T/C% = 20.5 %). Conclusions: Combined treatments with vorinostat promote the cytotoxicity of cisplatin and induce the expression of vorinostat-regulated acetyl proteins, eventually enhancing antitumor effects in SCLC cell lines. Triple combinations with a low dosage of cisplatin demonstrate similar therapeutic effects. Such triple combinations, if applied clinically, may reduce the undesired adverse effects of cisplatin. The effects of the combination of vorinostat and cisplatin should be evaluated further before conducting clinical trials for SCLC treatment. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Cisplatin; Combination therapy; HDAC inhibitor; SCLC; Vorinostat,"alpha tubulin; cisplatin; etoposide; histone H3; thymidylate synthase; vorinostat; antineoplastic agent; cisplatin; histone deacetylase inhibitor; hydroxamic acid; vorinostat; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer inhibition; cell cycle arrest; cell death; cell viability; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; histone acetylation; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; lung cancer cell line; male; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; small cell lung cancer; tumor xenograft; animal; cell cycle; cell survival; disease model; drug effects; drug potentiation; drug screening; Lung Neoplasms; pathology; Small Cell Lung Carcinoma; tumor cell line; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Cell Cycle; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Cisplatin; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Synergism; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Humans; Hydroxamic Acids; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Small Cell Lung Carcinoma; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-84994472213

Moreover, the effect of three types, namely, contact, local, and global, of infection awareness and immunization awareness is also taken into consideration.

In particular, we show that, for any initial conditions, the epidemic eventually dies out regardless of what other factors are whenever some type of immunization awareness is considered, and vaccination has a perfect success. Moreover, the threshold is independent of the global type of awareness. Second, we compare the effect of contact and local types of awareness on the epidemic thresholds between heterogeneous networks and homogeneous networks. Specifically, we find that the epidemic threshold for the homogeneous network can be lower than that of the heterogeneous network in an intermediate regime for intensity of contact infection awareness while it is higher otherwise. In summary, our results highlight the important and crucial roles of both vaccine success and contact infection awareness on epidemic dynamics. ? 2016 Author(s).",,vaccine; disease predisposition; epidemic; human; immunization; vaccination; Disease Susceptibility; Epidemics; Humans; Immunization; Vaccination; Vaccines,2-s2.0-84995537894

Because of their small size, they can remain suspended for a relatively longer time in the air than coarse particles and thus can travel long distances in the atmosphere. PM2.5 is one of the key indicators of pollution and known to cause numerous types of respiratory and lung-related diseases. Due to poor implementation of regulations and a time lag in introducing the vehicle technology, levels of PM2.5 in most Asian cities are much worse than those in European environments. Dedicated reviews on understanding the characteristics of PM2.5 in Asian urban environments are currently missing but much needed. In order to fill the existing gaps in the literature, the aim of this review article is to describe dominating sources and their classification, followed by current status and health impact of PM2.5, in Asian countries. Further objectives include a critical synthesis of the topics such as secondary and tertiary aerosol formation, chemical composition, monitoring and modelling methods, source apportionment, emissions and exposure impacts. The review concludes with the synthesis of regulatory guidelines and future perspectives for PM2.5 in Asian countries.

Circulating miRs as biomarkers for heart failure in mitral regurgitation patients (MR) remain unexplored. Methods This case-control study enrolled 32 MR patients with heart failure, 16 asymptomatic MR patients, and 12 control subjects without heart failure. We used next generation sequencing to study the gene expression profiles in the sera, and quantitative RT-PCR to study serum and tissue miRs in the left atria. Results Next generation sequencing analysis and enrichment analysis showed that 25 miRs were differentially expressed in the sera of MR patients with heart failure compared to control subjects. The circulating miR-148b-3p (p = 0.002) and miR-409-3p (p = 0.010) were significantly down-regulated in the MR patients with heart failure compared to control subjects. However, only circulation miR-148b-3p was significantly down-regulated in the MR patients without heart failure compared to control subjects (p = 0.009). The tissue miR-409-3p was significantly down-regulated in the MR patients with heart failure compared to 3 purchased normal controls (p = 0.041). Notably, the tissue RASGRP3 mRNA, target gene of miR-409-3p, was significantly up-regulated in the MR patients with heart failure compared to normal controls (p = 0.010). The tissue FRY (p = 0.010) and GADD45A (p = 0.010) mRNAs, target genes of miR-148b-3p, were significantly up-regulated in the MR patients with heart failure compared to normal controls.

As a result, crashes that are classified in the same category may contain many different crash sequences. This makes it difficult to develop effective countermeasures because these crash categorizations are based on the outcomes rather than the preceding events. Consequently, the efficacy of a countermeasure designed for a specific type of crash may not be appropriate due to different pre-crash sequences. This research seeks to explore the use of event sequence to characterize crashes. Additionally, this research seeks to identify crash sequences that are likely to result in severe crash outcomes so that researchers can develop effective countermeasures to reduce severe crashes. This study utilizes the sequence of events from roadway departure crashes in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), and converts the information to form a new categorization called “crash sequences.” The similarity distance between each pair of crash sequences were calculated using the Optimal Matching approach. Cluster analysis was applied to group crash sequences that are etiologically similar in terms of the similarity distance. A hybrid model was constructed to mitigate the potential sample selection bias of FARS data, which is biased toward more severe crashes. The major findings include: (1) in terms of a roadway departure crash, the crash sequences that are most likely to result in high crash severity include a vehicle that first crosses the median or centerline, runs-off-road on the left, and then collides with a roadside fixed-object; (2) seat-belt and airbag usage reduces the probability of dying in a roadway departure crash by 90%; and (3) occupants who are seated on the side of the vehicle that experience a direct impact are 2.6 times more likely to die in a roadway departure crash than those not seated on the same side of the vehicle where the impact occurs. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Crash characterization; Crash sequence; Crash severity; FARS,"Cluster analysis; Crashworthiness; Highway accidents; Highway engineering; Off road vehicles; Vehicles; Contributing factor; Crash sequence; Crash severity; FARS; Fatality analysis reporting systems; Multiple dimensions; Sample selection bias; Similarity distance; Accidents; accident prevention; human; prevention and control; procedures; safety; system analysis; theoretical model; traffic accident; Wounds and Injuries; Accident Prevention; Accidents, Traffic; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Safety; Systems Analysis; Wounds and Injuries",2-s2.0-84982217665

Here, the effect of nanotopography alongside the in vivo factor, shear stress, on osteoblast cell behavior, is reported. Tantalum oxide nanodots of 50 or 100 nm diameter were engineered using anodized aluminum oxide as a template. Bare tantalum nitride coated silicon substrates were taken as control (flat). MG63 (osteoblast) cells were seeded for 72 hours on flat, 50 or 100 nm nanodots and modulation in cell morphology, cell viability and expression of integrins was studied. Cells displayed a well-extended morphology on 50 nm nanodots in contrast to an elongated morphology on 100 nm nanodots, as observed by scanning electron microscopy and immunofluorescence staining, thereby confirming the cellular response to different nanotopographies. Based on quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction data, a greater fold change in the expression of α 1 , α 2 , α 3 , α 8 , α 9 , α V, β 1 , β 4 , β 5 , β 7 and β 8 integrins was observed in cells cultured on 100 nm than on 50 nm nanodots. Moreover, in the presence of a shear stress of 2 dyne/cm2, a 52% increase in the cell viability after culturing the cells for 72 hours was observed on 100 nm nanodots as compared to 50 nm nanodots, thereby validating the effect of shear stress on cell behavior. Duration-of-culture experiments revealed 100 nm nanodots to be an ideal nanotopography choice to engineer optimized implant geometries for an ideal cell response. This study highlights the in vivo factors which need to be considered while designing nanotopographies for in vivo applications, for an ideal response as the cell-nanomaterial interface.

However, the role of the temporal resolution of DWI in investigating parotid gland function remains uncertain. Our aim was to design a hightemporal-resolution echo-planar DWI pulse sequence and to evaluate the instantaneous MR perfusion responses of the parotid glands to gustatory stimulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study enrolled 21 healthy volunteers (M/F=2:1; mean age, 45.2 < 12.9 years). All participants underwent echo-planar DWI (total scan time, 304 seconds; temporal resolution, 4 s/scan) on a 1.5T MR imaging scanner. T2WI (b=0 s/mm2) and DWI (b=200 s/mm2) were qualitatively assessed. Signal intensity of the parotid glands on T2WI, DWI, and ADC was quantitatively analyzed. One-way ANOVA with post hoc group comparisons with Bonferroni correction was used for statistical analysis. P=.05 was statistically significant. RESULTS: Almost perfect interobserver agreement was achieved (= < 0.656). The parotid glands had magnetic susceptibility artifacts in 14.3% (3 of 21) of volunteers during swallowing on DWI but were free from perceptible artifacts at the baseline and at the end of scans on all images. Increased ADC and reduced signal intensity of the parotid glands on T2WI and DWI occurred immediately after oral administration of lemon juice. Maximal signal change of ADC (24.8%<10.8%) was significantly higher than that of T2WI (10.1%<5.2%, P.001). The recovery ratio of ADC (100.71% < 42.34%) was also significantly higher than that of T2WI (22.36% < 15.54%, P=.001).

Patients were divided into VRC group (55 patients) and conventional suture group (nine patients) based on the use of VRC during the operation. The preoperative characteristics, operative variables, and postoperative outcomes were collected and analyzed. Results: Male patients predominated in both groups. The mean times of cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp were 200.1 ± 99.9 and 193.6 ± 54.7 min (P = 0.425) and 107.5 ± 56.2 and 112.3 ± 40.8 min (P = 0.404) in the VRC group and suture group, respectively. There were more blood transfusions within 24 h (1513.3 ± 949.2 vs. 841.8 ± 801.1 ml) and more mediastinal drainage amount (1314.4 ± 650.3 ml vs. 942.1 ± 527.2 ml) in the suture group than in the VRC group. In the VRC group, 36.3% of patients did not require blood transfusion. Moreover, the pumping time and cardiac ischemic times were longer in the one-VRC group than in the two-VRC group. Operative mortality did not differ between the two groups (10.9% in VRC and 11.1% in suture group, P = 0.985). No dislodgement of VRC during or after operation and no bleeding from sutureless anastomosis site were noted. Conclusion: Use of VRC is associated with equivalent operative mortality and morbidity compared to suture group in patients with AAAD undergoing an emergent operation. This study demonstrates the clinical safety and efficacy of VRC in reducing the need of blood transfusion within 24 h and mediastinal drainage within 72 h. However, further randomized studies and long-term surveillance of the use of VRC in AAAD are still mandatory. ? 2016 Journal of Medical Sciences.",Acute type A aortic dissection; Conventional suture; Surgical outcomes; Vascular ring connector,adult; aged; anastomosis; anastomotic device; aorta dissection; Article; atrioventricular block; blood transfusion; brain infarction; cardiopulmonary bypass; computer assisted tomography; conventional suture technique; female; human; ischemic heart disease; length of stay; major clinical study; male; multiple organ failure; postoperative period; retrospective study; septic shock; sternotomy; surgical mortality; suturing method; vascular ring; vascular ring connector,2-s2.0-84992585829

However, the effects of elevated blood glucose levels on the virulence of this pathogen remain largely unknown. Type 3 fimbriae, encoded by the mrkABCDF genes, are important virulence factors in K. pneumoniae pathogenesis. In this study, the effects of exogenous glucose and the intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathway on type 3 fimbriae expression regulation were investigated. The production of MrkA, the major subunit of type 3 fimbriae, was increased in glucose-rich medium, whereas cAMP supplementation reversed the effect. MrkA production was markedly increased by cyaA or crp deletion, but slightly decreased by cpdA deletion. In addition, the mRNA levels of mrkABCDF genes and the activity of PmrkA were increased in Δcrp strain, as well as the mRNA levels of mrkHIJ genes that encode cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP)-related regulatory proteins that influence type 3 fimbriae expression. Moreover, the activities of PmrkHIand PmrkJwere decreased in ΔlacZΔcrp strain. These results indicate that CRP-cAMP down-regulates mrkABCDF and mmrkHIJ at the transcriptional level. Further deletion of mrkH or mrkI in Δcrp strain diminished the production of MrkA, indicating that MrkH and MrkI are required for the CRP regulation of type 3 fimbriae expression. Furthermore, the high activity of PmrkHI in the ΔlacZΔcrp strain was diminished in ΔlacZΔcrpΔmrkHI, but increased in the ΔlacZΔcrpΔmrkJ strain. Deletion of crp increased the intracellular c-di-GMP concentration and reduced the phosphodiesterase activity. Moreover, we found that the mRNA levels of multiple genes related to c-di-GMP metabolism were altered in Δcrp strain. These indicatethat CRP regulates type 3 fimbriae expression indirectly via the c-di-GMP signaling pathway. In conclusion, we found evidence of a coordinated regulation of type 3 fimbriae expression by the CRP-cAMP and c-di-GMP signaling pathways in K. pneumoniae. ? 2016 Lin et al.

Although the essential properties of the favorable two one-sided tests of equivalence have been addressed in the literature, the associated power and sample size calculations were illustrated mainly for selecting the most appropriate approximate method. Moreover, conventional power analysis does not consider the allocation restrictions and cost issues of different sample size choices. To extend the practical usefulness of the two one-sided tests procedure, this article describes exact approaches to sample size determinations under various allocation and cost considerations. Because the presented features are not generally available in common software packages, both R and SAS computer codes are presented to implement the suggested power and sample size computations for planning equivalence studies. The exact power function of the TOST procedure is employed to compute optimal sample sizes under four design schemes allowing for different allocation and cost concerns. The proposed power and sample size methodology should be useful for medical sciences to plan equivalence studies. ? 2016 Gwowen Shieh.

Methods: A retrospective observational cohortstudy was conducted using data from the National Health Insurance Database of Taiwan between the year of 2001 and 2009. A total of 527 OCD patients with 412 subjects in the SSRI use group and 115 in the non SSRI use group were included. Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models were used to explore the associations between SSRI use and the occurrence of stroke, controlling for age, gender, concomitant medications, and comorbid medical illnesses. Results: A total of nineteen OCD patients were diagnosed with new onset of stroke during the follow-up period including six cases in the SSRI group and thirteenin the non SSRI use group. SSRI use was demonstratedto be associated with a decreased risk of stroke (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.10-0.86, P = 0.02). The increase in age-related risk of strokes was 2.55 per decade (HR = 2.55; 95% CI = 1.74-3.75, P<0.001). Alternatively, sex, concomitant use of aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs, and comorbidities with angina pectoris, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were not found to be associated with an increased risk for stroke in OCD patients. Conclusions Our study showed that SSRI use was associated with decreased risk of stroke in OCD patients. Further investigation into the possible biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between stroke and SSRI use in OCD patients is warranted. ? 2016 Chu et al.

Particularly, the unlabeled data describes the participants in health examinations whose health conditions can vary greatly from healthy to very-ill. There is no ground truth for differentiating their states of health.

There is no effective SMA treatment. Loganin is a botanical candidate with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, glucose-lowering and anti-diabetic nephropathy activities. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential protective effects of loganin on SMA using two cellular models, SMN-deficient NSC34 cells and SMA patient fibroblasts, and an animal disease model, SMAΔ7 mice. In SMN-deficient NSC34 cells, loganin increased cell viability, neurite length, and expressions of SMN, Gemin2, SMN-Gemin2 complex, p-Akt, p-GSK-3β, p-CREB, BDNF and Bcl-2. However, both AG1024 (IGF-1 R antagonist) and IGF-1 R siRNA attenuated the protective effects of loganin on SMN level and cell viability in SMN-deficient NSC34 cells. In SMA patient fibroblasts, loganin up-regulated levels of SMN, FL-SMN2, and Gemins, increased numbers of SMN-containing nuclear gems, modulated splicing factors, and up-regulated p-Akt. Furthermore, in the brain, spinal cord and gastrocnemius muscle of SMAΔ7 mice, loganin up-regulated the expressions of SMN and p-Akt. Results from righting reflex and hind-limb suspension tests indicated loganin improved muscle strength of SMAΔ7 mice; moreover, loganin activated Akt/mTOR signal and inhibited atrogin-1/MuRF-1 signal in gastrocnemius muscle of SMAΔ7 mice. Loganin also increased body weight, but the average lifespan of loganin (20?mg/kg/day)-treated SMA mice was 16.80?±?0.73 days, while saline-treated SMA mice was 10.91?±?0.96 days. In conclusion, the present results demonstrate that loganin provides benefits to SMA therapeutics via improving SMN restoration, muscle strength and body weight. IGF-1 plays an important role in loganin neuroprotection. Loganin can be therefore a valuable complementary candidate for treatment of neuromuscular diseases via regulation of muscle protein synthesis and neuroprotection. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Akt/mTOR; IGF-1; Loganin; Muscular atrophy; Neuroprotection; Survival motor neuron protein,"atrogin 1; brain derived neurotrophic factor; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; gemin2 protein; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; helicase; loganin; mammalian target of rapamycin; muscle RING finger 1 protein; protein bcl 2; protein kinase B; small interfering RNA; survival motor neuron protein; unclassified drug; Fbxo32 protein, mouse; insulin-like growth factor-1, mouse; iridoid; loganin; MTOR protein, human; mTOR protein, mouse; muscle protein; neuroprotective agent; protein kinase B; Smn1 protein, mouse; somatomedin C; survival motor neuron protein 1; target of rapamycin kinase; Trim63 protein, mouse; tripartite motif protein; ubiquitin protein ligase; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; body weight; brain protection; cell viability; controlled study; drug effect; drug mechanism; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; gastrocnemius muscle; hind limb suspension test; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; lifespan; motor function test; mouse; muscle protection; muscle strength; neurite; nonhuman; priority journal; protection; protein expression; protein synthesis regulation; righting reflex test; spinal muscular atrophy; upregulation; animal; apoptosis; biosynthesis; cell line; cell protection; disease model; dose response; drug effects; enzymology; fibroblast; genetic predisposition; genetic transfection; genetics; metabolism; motoneuron; motor activity; mutation; nerve degeneration; pathology; pathophysiology; phenotype; phosphorylation; protein synthesis; RNA interference; signal transduction; skeletal muscle; spinal muscular atrophy; time factor; transgenic mouse; weight gain; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Line; Cytoprotection; Disease Models, Animal; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Fibroblasts; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Iridoids; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Motor Activity; Motor Neurons; Muscle Proteins; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Muscular Atrophy, Spinal; Mutation; Nerve Degeneration; Neuroprotective Agents; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Protein Biosynthesis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; RNA Interference; Signal Transduction; SKP Cullin F-Box Protein Ligases; Survival of Motor Neuron 1 Protein; Time Factors; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Transfection; Tripartite Motif Proteins; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases; Weight Gain",2-s2.0-84976295564

This study investigated the roles of extracellular visfatin in breast cancer, and explored underlying mechanisms in clinical and experimental settings. Experimental Design: Associations of serum visfatin with clinicopathologic characteristics and patient survival were assessed with Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Effects of extracellular visfatin on cultured breast cancer cells were examined, followed by in vivo investigation of tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft animal models. Imatinib and Stattic were used to inhibit c-Abl and STAT3 activation, respectively. Results: Breast cancer patients with high serum visfatin levels were associated with advanced tumor stage, increased tumor size and lymph node metastasis, and poor survival. Elevated phosphorylation of c-Abl and STAT3 in breast tumor tissues were correlated with high serum visfatin levels in patients. Visfatinpromoted in vitro cell viability and metastatic capability were suppressed by imatinib (c-Abl inhibitor) and Stattic (STAT3 inhibitor). Increased in vivo cell invasiveness was observed in zebrafish xenografted with visfatin-pretreated breast cancer cells. Tumor growth and lung metastasis occurred in visfatin-administered mice xenografted with breast cancer cells. Tail vein-injected mice with visfatin-pretreated breast cancer cells showed increased lung metastasis, which was suppressed by imatinib. Conclusions: Serum visfatin levels in breast cancer patients reveal potential prognostic values, and our findings that visfatin promoted breast cancer through activation of c-Abl and STAT3 may provide an important molecular basis for future design of targeted therapies that take into account different serum visfatin levels in breast cancer. ?2016 American Association for Cancer Research.",,"Abelson kinase; imatinib; nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; STAT3 protein; Abelson kinase; biological marker; nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; STAT3 protein; tumor marker; adult; advanced cancer; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; breast cancer; cancer staging; cancer survival; carcinogenesis; cell invasion; cell viability; controlled study; embryo; female; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; lung metastasis; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein blood level; protein phosphorylation; tumor growth; tumor volume; aged; animal; blood; breast tumor; cancer grading; cell motion; cell survival; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; disease model; drug effects; drug screening; extracellular space; genetics; Kaplan Meier method; metabolism; metastasis; middle aged; pathology; prognosis; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Adult; Aged; Animals; Biomarkers; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Survival; Disease Models, Animal; Disease Progression; Extracellular Space; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Mice; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Staging; Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase; Prognosis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl; Signal Transduction; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Tumor Burden; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-84973878904

It can be used for walking assistance as well as for rehabilitation. Pressure sensors were set under both feet to detect the user's center of pressure(COP). The COP is included in the control loop to improve balance in walking. In the control design, the assist torque from motors consists of three parts, namely the support torque, the gravity compensation torque, and the correction torque. The support torque is generated based on the estimated user's external torque during walking. The gravity compensation torque is calculated by using posture data of the exoskeleton to compensate gravity effect of the mechanism. The correction torque is based on user balance state to allow a user to keep balance when he/she tends to lost body balance. We have designed and constructed a prototype of lower limb exoskeleton adopting a modular design approach. The experimental results verified the effectiveness of proposed control system.

This antiviral effect of HO-1 was attenuated by its inhibitor tin protoporphyrin (SnPP), suggesting that HO-1 was an important cellular factor against DENV replication. Biliverdin but not carbon monoxide and ferrous ions, which are products of the HO-1 on heme, mediated the HO-1-induced anti-DENV effect by non-competitively inhibiting DENV protease, with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 8.55 ± 0.38 μM. Moreover, HO-1 induction or its exogenous overexpression, rescued DENV-suppressed antiviral interferon response. Moreover, we showed that HO-1 induction by cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) and andrographolide, a natural product, as evidenced by a significant delay in the onset of disease and mortality, and virus load in the infected mice's brains. These findings clearly revealed that a drug or therapy that induced the HO-1 signal pathway was a promising strategy for treating DENV infection.",,"alpha interferon; andrographolide; biliverdin; carbon monoxide; cyclohexyl-octahydro-pyrrolo(1,2-a)pyrazine; diterpene; enzyme inhibitor; heme oxygenase 1; HMOX1 protein, human; iron; metalloporphyrin; NS3 protease, dengue virus; protoporphyrin; protoporphyrin tin; pyrazine derivative; pyrrole derivative; serine proteinase; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; dengue; Dengue virus; disease model; drug effect; enzymology; genetics; host pathogen interaction; human; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; metabolism; mortality; pathogenicity; physiology; virology; virus replication; Animals; Biliverdine; Carbon Monoxide; Dengue; Dengue Virus; Disease Models, Animal; Diterpenes; Enzyme Inhibitors; Heme Oxygenase-1; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Interferon-alpha; Iron; Metalloporphyrins; Mice, Inbred ICR; Protoporphyrins; Pyrazines; Pyrroles; Serine Endopeptidases; Virus Replication",2-s2.0-84984688892

The multifunctional magnetic nanocarriers (MNCs) composed of single-component thiol-functionalized PVA/PMASH copolymer and superparamagnetic nanoparticles are developed for providing tunable dual-targeting ability and simultaneously modulating pH-responsive on/off drug release. Results show that plasma doxorubicin (Dox) concentration of the mice treated with Trastuzumab (Tra)-targeted Dox-MNCs can be rapidly decreased by applying dual-targeting treatment. More importantly, cooperative modulation of magnetic targeting and Tra density on the nanocarrier significantly optimize intratumoral distribution and enhance the utilization rate of nanomedicines within tumor to inhibit tumor growth. The mice treated with 2T-Dox-MNCs + multistage magnetic targeting (MT) (2 h d?1) show 7.63-fold, 3.25-fold, and 2.7-fold reduction in HER2-positive tumor volume compared to Dox-MNCs, 2T-Dox-MNCs, and 2T-Dox-MNCs + single MT (12 h).

However, the mechanisms of TUG1-involved regulation remain largely unknown. Methods: We examined the expressions of TUG1 in a cohort of 89 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to determine the association between TUG1 expression and clinical parameters. We used circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) coupled with next-generation sequencing to explore the genome regions that interact with TUG1 and the TUG1-mediated regulation. Results: TUG1 was significantly downregulated, and the TUG1 downregulation correlated with sex (p=0.006), smoking status (p=0.016), and tumor differentiation grade (p=0.001). Knockdown of TUG1 significantly promoted the proliferation of NSCLC cells. According to the bioinformatic analysis result of TUG1 4C sequencing data, 83 candidate genes and their interaction regions were identified. Among these candidate genes, CUGBP and Elav-like family member 1 (CELF1) are potential targets of TUG1 in-trans regulation. To confirm the interaction between TUG1 and CELF1, relative expressions of CELF1 were examined in TUG1 knockdown H520 cells; results showed that CELF1 was significantly upregulated in TUG1 knockdown H520 cells. RNA immunoprecipitation was then performed to examine whether TUG1 RNA was bound to PRC2, a TUG1-involved regulation mechanism reported in previous studies. The results demonstrated that TUG1 RNA was bound to enhancer of zeste protein 2/embryonic ectoderm development (EZH2/EED), which is essential for PRC2. Finally, our designed ChIP assay revealed that the EZH2/EED was bound to the promotor region of CELF1 within 992 bp upstream of the transcript start site. Conclusion:TUG1 is downregulated in NSCLC. Using TUG1 4C sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, we found CELF1 to be a potential target of TUG1 RNA in in-trans regulation. Moreover, subsequent experiments showed that TUG1 RNA could bind to PRC2 in the promotor region of CELF1 and negatively regulate CELF1 expressions in H520 cells. Our results may facilitate developing new treatment modalities targeting TUG1/PRC2/CELF1 interactions in patients with NSCLC. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Circular chromosome conformation capture (4C); CUGBP and Elav-like family member 1 (CELF1); Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA); Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); Taurine-upregulated gene 1 (TUG1),"CELF1 protein; long untranslated RNA; polycomb repressive complex 2; short hairpin RNA; unclassified drug; zeste protein 2; CELF1 protein; CELF1 protein, human; long untranslated RNA; polycomb repressive complex 2; TUG1 long noncoding RNA, human; Article; bioinformatics; cancer cell culture; cancer grading; CELF1 gene; cell proliferation; chromatin immunoprecipitation; circular chromosome conformation capture; controlled study; CUGBP gene; down regulation; gene expression; genetic procedures; human; human cell; human tissue; major clinical study; next generation sequencing; non small cell lung cancer; promoter region; protein binding; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; smoking; taurine upregulated gene 1; transcription initiation site; tumor differentiation; tumor gene; down regulation; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; high throughput sequencing; lung tumor; male; metabolism; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; procedures; survival analysis; transcription initiation; tumor cell line; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; CELF1 Protein; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Down-Regulation; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Polycomb Repressive Complex 2; Promoter Regions, Genetic; RNA, Long Noncoding; Survival Analysis; Transcriptional Activation",2-s2.0-84988354782

Wheezes are important in the diagnosis of pulmonary pathologies such as asthma. The acoustic features of wheezes are distinct in the frequency domain. Therefore, many studies have focused on detecting wheezing peaks in spectrograms through image processing. However, automated detection of wheezing peaks is difficult because of blurred edges and noise. This paper proposes an alternative approach for wheezing detection in which the mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are integrated into the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The MFCCs reduce the short-term spectral information to a few coefficients, and the GMM recognizes the respiratory sounds. The respiratory sounds of 18 volunteers (9 asthmatic and 9 normal adults) were recorded for training and testing. The results of a qualitative analysis of wheeze recognition showed a good sensitivity of 0.881 and a high specificity of 0.995. ? 2016, Taiwanese Society of Biomedical Engineering.",Asthma; Gaussian mixture model; Mel frequency cepstral coefficients; Short-term spectra; Wheezing,Diseases; Frequency domain analysis; Gaussian distribution; Image processing; Asthma; Gaussian Mixture Model; Mel frequency cepstral co-efficient; Short-term spectrum; Wheezing; Speech recognition; abnormal respiratory sound; Article; asthma; automatic speech recognition; clinical article; controlled study; human; qualitative analysis; sensitivity and specificity; statistical analysis; statistical model; wheezing,2-s2.0-84986917928

Patients with decreased kidney function and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have increased risk of hypoglycemia when attaining better glycemic control, leading to higher risk of myocardial infarction (MI). For these patients, which kinds of anti-hyperglycemic agents would be associated with higher risk of MI is not clear. Methods We identified patients from a nation-wide database called Registry for Catastrophic Illness, which encompassed almost 100% of the patients receiving dialysis therapy in Taiwan from 1995 to 2008. Patients with diabetes and ESRD were selected as the study cohort. Propensity score adjustment and Cox's proportional hazards regression model were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for new-onset MI. Results Among 15,161 patients, 39% received insulin, 40% received sulfonylureas, 18% received meglitinides and 3% received thiazolidinedione (TZD). After a median follow-up of 1,357 days, the incidence of MI was significant increase in patients taking sulfonylureas (HR = 1.523, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.331-1.744), meglitinides (HR = 1.251, 95% CI = 1.048-1.494) and TZD (HR = 1.515, 95% CI = 1.071-2.145) by using patients receiving insulin therapy as the reference group. The risk of MI remains higher in other three groups in subgroup analyses. Conclusions In conclusion, among diabetic patients with ESRD undergoing dialysis, the use of sulfonylureas, meglitinides and TZD are associated with higher risk of new-onset MI as compared with insulin. ? 2016 Lin et al.

Screening skin metabolites could unravel the pathophysiology of psoriasis and provide new diagnostic approaches. Due to the lack of suitable methodologies for collecting scarce amounts of skin excretions, the psoriatic skin metabolome has not been extensively studied. METHODS: We implemented biocompatible hydrogel micropatch probes combined with mass spectrometry to investigate the skin metabolome. This noninvasive approach was applied to examine samples obtained from 100 psoriatic patients and 100 healthy individuals. We also developed custom data treatment tools and used chemometric and statistical tools to reveal the alterations in the skin metabolome caused by psoriasis. RESULTS: The proposed methodology enabled us to capture alterations in the composition of skin excretions caused by the disease. Chemometric analysis revealed the major differences between the metabolomes of psoriatic skin and healthy skin. Several polar metabolites were positively (choline and glutamic acid) or negatively (urocanic acid and citrulline) correlated with the plaque severity scores. The amounts of these metabolites in the excretions sampled from psoriatic skin were significantly different (P < 0.001) from the excretions sampled from healthy skin. The role of biological variability and various confounding factors, which might affect the skin metabolome, was also investigated. CONCLUSIONS: Sampling lesional and healthy skin with the hydrogel micropatch probes and subsequent direct mass spectrometry scanning provided information on the alterations in the skin metabolome caused by psoriasis, increasing the understanding of the complex pathophysiology of this disease. ? 2016 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.",,choline; citrulline; glutamic acid; urocanic acid; biomaterial; hydrogel; adult; Article; biocompatibility; chemometric analysis; controlled study; excretion; female; human; hydrogel; hydrogel micropatch; major clinical study; male; mass spectrometry; metabolite; metabolome; middle aged; non invasive procedure; psoriasis; skin; transdermal patch; chemistry; hydrogel; mass spectrometry; metabolism; psoriasis; Biocompatible Materials; Female; Humans; Hydrogel; Male; Mass Spectrometry; Middle Aged; Psoriasis,2-s2.0-84979999791

Modern hearing aid systems include a frequency decomposer, noise reduction, feedback cancellation, auditory compensation, and intelligent adaptation. The majority of existing works concentrated on improving the performance and efficiency on a single-signal processing block or one-sided effect. These works lacked comprehensive discussions on system-wide aspects regarding the overall impacts. To design an optimal hearing aid system, frequency decomposers, or the filter banks that dominate in hearing aid systems, are the first priority. We propose a systematic relaxation of the ANSI S1.11 specification and its design procedure for filter banks. The proposed design procedure overcomes the drawbacks of previous works and changes the five performance indices of the filter bank: delay, complexity, sub-band rate reduction, ripples of synthesized output, and prescription matching errors. These performance indices help system or algorithm designers in selecting a beneficial system-relaxed filter bank to achieve optimal hearing aids. The proposed multirate filter bank using the resampling method provides an efficient, low complexity, and delay-constrained computing architecture. Finally, seven design cases are used to demonstrate the proposed method, and comprehensive discussions of the five performance indices are presented. ? 2014 IEEE.",ANSI S1.11; Hearing aids; Multi-rate filter bank; NAL-NL1; Prescription matching; quasi-ANSI,Application specific integrated circuits; Bandpass filters; Computer architecture; Design; Filter banks; Hearing aids; Integrated circuit design; Optimal systems; Signal processing; Specifications; System-on-chip; ANSI S1.11; Multi rate; NAL-NL1; Prescription matching; quasi-ANSI; Audition,2-s2.0-84976350953

Timely intervention with stenting procedures can effectively prevent secondary stroke; however, the impact of stenting on various periprocedural physical functionalities has never been thoroughly investigated. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether prestenting characteristics were associated with long-term functional outcomes in patients presenting with first-ever ischemic stroke. The secondary aim was to investigate whether patient age was an important factor in outcomes following stenting, measured by the modified Rankin scale (mRS). In total, 144 consecutive patients with first-ever ischemic stroke who underwent carotid artery stenting from January 2010 to November 2014 were included. Clinical data were obtained by review of medical records. The Barthel index (BI) and mRS were used to assess disability before stenting and at 12-month follow-up. In total, 72/144 patients showed improvement (mRS[+]), 71 showed stationary and one showed deterioration in condition (mRS[-]). The prestenting parameters, ratio of cerebral blood volume (1.41 vs 1.2 for mRS[-] vs mRS[+]), BI (75 vs 85), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP 5.0 vs 3.99), differed significantly between the two outcome groups (P,0.05). The internal carotid artery/common carotid artery ratio (P=0.011), BI (P=0.019), ipsilateral internal carotid artery resistance index (P=0.003), and HbA1c (P=0.039) were all factors significantly associated with patient age group. There was no significant association between age and poststenting outcome measured by mRS with 57% of patients in the ?75 years age group showing mRS(-) and 43% showing mRS(+) (P=0.371). Our findings indicate that in our elderly patient series, carotid artery stenting may benefit a significant proportion of carotid stenotic patients regardless of age.

Three-dimensional microscopic distribution of melanin in pigmented lesions of mouse skin is obtained directly with this setup. Classic morphometric and fractal analysis of sixteen 3D images (eight for benign melanoma and eight for malignant) showed a capability of pathology of melanoma: melanin density and size become larger during the melanoma growth, and the melanin distribution also becomes more chaotic and unregulated.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used in the analysis of the lipids present in the biological matrixes. However, MS analysis of liposome and cell suspensions is challenging due to the presence of other high-abundance matrix components (e.g., salts, buffers, and growth media) that cause ion suppression. These interfering species would normally be removed by dialysis or centrifugation. Here we propose a simple and fast method to detect major lipid components in cells and cell suspensions by MS while circumventing dialysis and centrifugation. Capillary hydrodynamic chromatography (HDC) has been coupled online with the aid of an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface to an ion-trap mass spectrometer. Complex samples containing bioparticles and a large amount of potential interferences (buffer, inorganic salts, amino acids) were separated hydrodynamically, detected optically (by light absorption/scattering), and immediately transferred to the MS interface. Liposomes and animal cells are disintegrated during electrospray, and the constituent lipids are ionized. The signal-to-noise ratios are ?10× higher in HDC-ESI-MS than in direct infusion ESI-MS experiments (with or without dilution). This method has been tested on liposomes (containing phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol) and four types of animal/human cells, i.e., mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7), human breast cancer cells (T47D and Hs578T), and mouse preadipocyte cells (3T3-L1).

The singlet oxygen produced by ultrasound-activated RB and the ultrasound-induced heating effect was enhanced by rGO and IONs, which improved the cytotoxic effect in cancer cells. In an animal experiment, we demonstrated that the combination of sonodynamic/hyperthermia therapy with magnetic guidance using this nanocomposite therapeutic agent can produce remarkable efficacious therapy in tumor growth inhibition.

Betatrophin, a novel liver-derived hormone, promotes β-cell proliferation and improves glucose intolerance. However, the relationship between betatrophin and PDAC-associated diabetes is not fully understood. To evaluate the serum betatrophin levels in PDAC-associated diabetes, a total 105 Taiwanese subjects including 15 healthy subjects, and 12 patients having PDAC with normal glucose tolerance (PDAC-NGT), 12 patients having PC with impaired glucose tolerance (PDAC-IGT), and 66 patients having PC with diabetes mellitus (PDAC-DM) were enrolled for this study. Serum betatrophin and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Compared to healthy subjects, PDAC patients had higher levels of betatrophin and CA19-9. Consistently, betatrophin protein was significantly expressed in pancreatic ductal of PDAC-associated DM patients using immunohistochemistry (IHC) method. Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis showed the betatrophin was significantly and positively independent with T category (β= 0.605, P=0.010), serum albumin (β= 0. 423, P=0.021), lipase (β= 0.292, P=0.039), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (β= 0.303, P=0.040). Further, the betatrophin was three folds of having PDAC-associated diabetes with the highest odds ratio [OR=3.39; 95% CI (1.20-9.57); P=0.021) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that AUC value of betarophin was 0.853 which is slightly larger than AUC value of CA19-9 (0.792) in PDAC-DM patients. Interestingly, AUC value of betarophin plus CA19-9 was 0.988 in PDAC-DM patients. Therefore, betatrophin combined CA19-9 may serve as a potential biomarker for PDAC-associated diabetes.",betatrophin; diabetes; glucose intolerance; insulin resistance; pancreatic cancer,"angiopoietin related protein; ANGPTL8 protein, human; CA 19-9 antigen; peptide hormone; tumor marker; aged; blood; case control study; cell proliferation; diabetic complication; female; glucose tolerance test; human; male; middle aged; pancreas tumor; receiver operating characteristic; Taiwan; Aged; Angiopoietin-like Proteins; Biomarkers, Tumor; CA-19-9 Antigen; Case-Control Studies; Cell Proliferation; Diabetes Complications; Female; Glucose Tolerance Test; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Peptide Hormones; ROC Curve; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85040788230

While protein sensors based on antibodies are not easy to keep for a long time, aptamers (single-stranded DNA) are found to be a good alternative for recognizing tumor-related protein specifically. This study investigates the feasibility of employing aptamers to recognize the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) specifically and subsequently triggering rolling circle amplification (RCA) of DNAs on extended-gate field-effect transistors (EGFETs) to enhance the sensitivity. The EGFETs are fabricated by the standard CMOS technology and integrated with readout circuits monolithically. The monolithic integration not only avoids the wiring complexity for a large sensor array but also enhances the sensor reliability and facilitates massive production for commercialization. With the RCA primers immobilized on the sensory surface, the protein signal is amplified as the elongation of DNA, allowing the EGFET to achieve a sensitivity of 8.8?pM, more than three orders better than that achieved by conventional EGFETs. Moreover, the responses of EGFETs are able to indicate quantitatively the reaction rates of RCA, facilitating the estimation on the protein concentration. Our experimental results demonstrate that immobilized RCA on EGFETs is a useful, label-free method for early diagnosis of diseases related to low-concentrated tumor makers (e.g., PDGF) for serum sample, as well as for monitoring the synthesis of various DNA nanostructures in real time.

We performed a multi-centre prospective observational study to identify the species and antifungal susceptibilities of invasive bloodstream isolates of Candida species in the Asia-Pacific region. The study was carried out over a two year period, involving 13 centers from Brunei, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Identification of Candida species was performed at each study center, and reconfirmed at a central laboratory. Susceptibility testing was performed using a commercial broth dilution panel (Sensititre YeastOne YST-010, Thermofisher, United Kingdom) with susceptibility categorisation (S??=??susceptible, S-DD??= susceptible dose-dependent) applied using breakpoints from the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute. Eight hundred and sixty-one Candida isolates were included in the study. The most common species were C.??albicans (35.9%), C.??tropicalis (30.7%), C.??parapsilosis (15.7%), and C.??glabrata (13.6%). Non-albicans species exceeded C. albicans species in centers from all countries except Taiwan. Fluconazole susceptibility was almost universal for C.??albicans (S??=??99.7%) but lower for C.??tropicalis (S??=??75.8%, S-DD??=??6.1%), C.??glabrata (S-DD??=??94.9%), and C.??parapsilosis (S??=??94.8%). Echinocandins demonstrated high rates of in vitro susceptibility (S>99%) against C.??albicans, C.??tropicalis, and C.??parapsilosis. This study demonstrates that non-albicans species are the most common isolates from bloodstream infections in most countries in the Asia-Pacific region, with C.??tropicalis as the predominant species. Because of the prevalence of reduced susceptibility to fluconazole in non-albicans species, the study indicates that echinocandins should be the antifungal of choice in clinically unstable or high-risk patients with documented candidemia. ? 2016, ??

However, the effects of posture and gender on HRV in symptomatic MVP and normal adults had not been elucidated in Taiwan. Methods: A total of 118 MVP patients (7 males, 39 ± 7 years old; and 111 females, 42 ± 13 years old) and 148 healthy control (54 males, 28 ± 4 years old; and 94 females, 26 ± 6 years old) were investigated. The diagnosis of MVP was confirmed by cross-sectional echocardiography. A locally developed Taiwanese machine was used to record the HRV parameters for MVP and control groups in three stationary positions. Thereafter, the HRV time-domain parameters, and the frequency-domain parameters derived from fast Fourier transform or autoregressive methods were analyzed. Results: The MVP group showed a decrease in time domain parameters and obtunded postural effects on frequency domain parameters moreso than the control group. Though the parasympathetic tone was dominant in female (higher RMSSD, nHF and lower nLF vs. male), the sympathetic outflow was higher in MVP female (lower SDNN, NN50 and higher nLF vs. normal female). While the parasympathetic activity was lower in male, sympathetic outflow was dominant inMVP male (lower nHF and higher nLF vs. normal male). Conclusions: Both MVP female and male subjects had elevated levels of sympathetic outflow. The obtunded postural effects on frequency domain measures testified to the autonomic dysregulation of MVP subjects. ? 2016, Republic of China Society of Cardiology.

In some situations, we also collect additional covariate W that has better performance in predicting Y, but has a higher obtaining cost, than X. While constructing a predictive model for Y based on (X,W) is straightforward, this strategy is not applicable since W is not available for future observations in which the constructed model is to be applied. As a result, the aim of the study is to build a predictive model for Y based on X only, where the available data is (Y,X,W). A naive method is to conduct analysis using (Y,X) directly, but ignoring W can cause the problem of inefficiency. On the other hand, it is not trivial to utilize the information of W to infer (Y,X), either. In this article, we propose a two-stage dimension reduction method for (Y,X) that is able to utilize the information of W. In the breast cancer data, the risk score constructed from the two-stage method can well separate patients with different survival experiences. In the Pima data, the two-stage method requires fewer components to infer the diabetes status, while achieving higher classification accuracy than the conventional method. ? 2015 The Author 2015.

In addition to its adverse effects on human health, the on- and off-road engines operated in ambient can also be affected. In this study, a simple system for generating simulated ambient bimodal PMs comprising fine (PM2.5), coarse (PM2.5–10) particles was developed for evaluating the initial efficiency of seven respirator and four engine intake filters. In addition to the size fractional efficiency curves for each filter media determined from the SMPS (scanning mobility particle sizer) and APS (aerodynamic particle sizer), both number and mass based efficiency of these filters for PM2.5, PM2.5–10 and PM10 were also obtained to evaluate their performances against ambient PM pollutions. Data showed that the engine intake filters had a low efficiency for both mass and number based PM2.5, which was only about 25–30%. However, there was a large difference between their number and mass based PM10 efficiency. The former was much lower than the latter because these filters are with high efficiency only for coarse particles. Besides, the most of particles in number was resided in the fine size range while the mass was in coarse size range. For the respirator filtration tests, results showed that most of them can effectively remove both PM2.5 and PM10, in which the mass efficiency was always higher than that of number. The PM2.5 number efficiency results showed there are three out of seven respirator filters are with N-95 rated level, in which the efficiency of their most penetrating particle size is higher than 95%. The current simple experimental system could be applied to examine different purpose filters which protect human health and outdoor engines against ambient PM2.5 and PM10. ?

Comparing closely related genomes sheds light on molecular events shaping phage evolution. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) variations impart over half of the genomic changes between T7M and T3, indicating an important role of SSRs in accelerating phage genetic divergence. Differences in coding and noncoding regions of phages infecting different hosts, coliphages T7M and T3, Yersinia phage φYeO3-12, and Salmonella phage φSG-JL2, frequently arise from SSR variations. Such variations modify noncoding and coding regions; the latter efficiently changes multiple amino acids, thereby hastening protein evolution. Four classes of events are found to drive SSR variations: insertion/deletion of SSR units, expansion/contraction of SSRs without alteration of genome length, changes of repeat motifs, and generation/loss of repeats. The categorization demonstrates the ways SSRs mutate in genomes during phage evolution. Indels are common constituents of genome variations and human diseases, yet, how they occur without preexisting repeat sequence is less understood. Non-repeat-unit-based misalignment-elongation (NRUBME) is proposed to be one mechanism for indels without adjacent repeats. NRUBME or consecutive NRUBME may also change repeat motifs or generate new repeats. NRUBME invoking a non-Watson-Crick base pair explains insertions that initiate mononucleotide repeats. Furthermore, NRUBME successfully interprets many inexplicable human di- to tetranucleotide repeat generations. This study provides the first evidence of SSR variations expediting phage divergence, and enables insights into the events and mechanisms of genome evolution. NRUBME allows us to emulate natural evolution to design indels for various applications. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Genome evolution; Human gene mutations; Insertion and deletion; Molecular mechanism; Phage divergence; Simple sequence repeat,"Article; bacterial genome; bacterial strain; bacteriophage; controlled study; DNA sequence; Escherichia coli; gene deletion; gene insertion; gene mutation; genetic variability; genome analysis; horizontal gene transfer; human; indel mutation; molecular dynamics; molecular evolution; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; population abundance; priority journal; Salmonella; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; simple sequence repeat; amino acid sequence; base pairing; Enterobacteria phage T3; Enterobacteria phage T7; genetics; virology; virus genome; microsatellite DNA; Amino Acid Sequence; Bacteriophage T3; Bacteriophage T7; Base Pairing; Base Sequence; Escherichia coli; Genome, Viral; INDEL Mutation; Microsatellite Repeats",2-s2.0-84964613696

In this study, the functional role of DDX3 in regulation of hepatic CSCs was investigated. Our results demonstrated that reduced DDX3 expression was not only inversely associated with tumor grade, but also predicted poor prognosis of HCC patients. Knockdown of DDX3 in HCC cell line HepG2 induced stemness gene signature followed by occurrence of self-renewal, chemoreisistance, EMT, migration as well as CSC expansion, and most importantly, DDX3 knockdown promotes tumorigenesis. Moreover, we found positive correlations between DDX3 level and expressions of tumor-suppressive miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-122 and miR-145, but not miR-10b and miR-519a, implying their involvement in DDX3 knockdown-induced CSC phenotypes. In addition, DDX3 reduction promoted up-regulation of DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), while neither DNMT3B nor DNMT1 expression was affected. Enriched DNMT3A binding along with hypermethylation on promoters of these tumor-suppressive miRNAs reflected their transcriptional repressions in DDX3-knockdown cells. Furthermore, individual restoration of these tumor-suppressive miRNAs represses DDX3 knockdown-induced CSC phenotypes. In conclusion, our study suggested that DDX3 prevents generation of CSCs through epigenetically regulating a subset of tumor-suppressive miRNAs expressions, which strengthens tumor suppressor role of DDX3 in HCC.",,"DDX3X protein, human; DEAD box protein; tumor protein; animal; biosynthesis; cancer stem cell; enzymology; gene expression regulation; genetic epigenesis; genetics; Hep-G2 cell line; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; male; mouse; nude mouse; pathology; SCID mouse; Animals; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; DEAD-box RNA Helicases; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; Mice, SCID; Neoplasm Proteins; Neoplastic Stem Cells",2-s2.0-84976427814

Membrane cholesterol can alter these signaling pathways of living cells. However, the process in which the interaction of activated receptors is modulated by cholesterol remains unclear. Methods: In this study, we measured single-molecule optical trajectories of epidermal growth factor receptors moving in the plasma membranes of two cancerous cell lines and one normal endothelial cell line. A stochastic model was developed and applied to identify critical information from single-molecule trajectories. Results: We discovered that unliganded epidermal growth factor receptors may reside nearby cholesterol-riched regions of the plasma membrane and can move into these lipid domains when subjected to ligand binding. The amount of membrane cholesterol considerably affects the stability of correlated motion of activated epidermal growth factor receptors. Conclusions: Our results provide single-molecule evidence of membrane cholesterol in regulating signaling receptors.

For this prospective cohort study, we evaluated 151 adult critical care patients (?20 years) who were intubated for at least 48hours and had no pre-existing neuromuscular disease or swallowing dysfunction. Participants were assessed for time (days) to pass bedside swallow evaluations (swallow 50mL of water without difficulty) and to resume total oral intake. Outcomes were compared between younger (20-64 years) and older participants (?65 years). PSD, defined as inability to swallow 50mL of water within 48hours after extubation, affected 92 participants (61.7% of our sample). At 21 days postextubation, 17 participants (15.5%) still failed to resume total oral intake and were feeding-tube dependent. We found that older participants had higher PSD rates at 7, 14, and 21 days postextubation, and took significantly longer to pass the bedside swallow evaluations (5.0 vs 3.0 days; P=0.006) and to resume total oral intake (5.0 vs 3.0 days; P=0.003) than their younger counterparts. Older participants also had significantly higher rates of subsequent feeding-tube dependence than younger patients (24.1 vs 5.8%; P=0.008). Excluding patients with pre-existing neuromuscular dysfunction, PSD is common and prolonged. Age matters in the time needed to recover.

Some scientific tools that may be able to replace these scales to objectively assess the severity, such as accelerometers, digital tablets, electromyography (EMG) measurement devices, and motion capture cameras, are currently available. However, most of the operational modes of these tools are relatively complex or are only able to capture part of the clinical information; furthermore, using these tools is sometimes time consuming. Currently, there is no tool available for automatically quantifying tremor severity in clinical environments. New method: We aimed to develop a rapid, objective, and quantitative system for measuring the severity of finger tremor using a small portable optical device (Leap Motion). Results: A single test took 15 s to conduct, and three algorithms were proposed to quantify the severity of finger tremor. The system was tested with four patients diagnosed with essential tremor. Comparison with existing method: The proposed algorithms were able to quantify different characteristics of tremor in clinical environments, and could be used as references for future clinical assessments.

However, fabricating SiQDs with high water-solubility and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) remains a challenge. Furthermore, for targeted imaging, their surface chemistry has to be capable of conjugating to antibodies, as well as sufficiently antifouling. Herein, antibody-conjugated SiQD nanoparticles (SiQD-NPs) with antifouling coatings composed of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) are demonstrated for immunostaining on live cancer cells. The monodisperse SiQD-NPs of diameter about 130 nm are synthesized by a novel top-down method, including electrochemical etching, photochemical hydrosilylation, high energy ball milling, and ""selective-etching"" in HNO3 and HF. Subsequently, the BSA and PEG are covalently grafted on to the SiQD-NP surface through presynthesized chemical linkers, resulting in a stable, hydrophilic, and antifouling organic capping layer with isothiocyanates as the terminal functional groups for facile conjugation to the antibodies. The in vitro cell viability assay reveals that the BSA-coated SiQD-NPs had exceptional biocompatibility, with minimal cytotoxicity at concentration up to 1600 μg mL-1. Under 365 nm excitation, the SiQD-NP colloid emits bright reddish photoluminescence with PLQY = 45-55% in organic solvent and 5-10% in aqueous buffer. Finally, through confocal fluorescent imaging and flow cytometry analysis, the anti-HER2 conjugated SiQD-NPs show obvious specific binding to the HER2-overexpressing SKOV3 cells and negligible nonspecific binding to the HER2-nonexpressing CHO cells.

Twelve healthy subjects participated in a sustained-attention driving experiment. Each participant's EEG signal was monitored continuously and a warning was delivered in real-time to participants once the EEG signature of fatigue was detected. Study results indicate suppression of the alpha-and theta-power of an occipital component and improved behavioral performance following a warning signal; these findings are in line with those in previous studies. However, study results also showed reduced warning efficacy (i.e. increased response times (RTs) to lane deviations) accompanied by increased alpha-power due to the fluctuation of warnings over time.

This disease affects multiple organ systems with varying degrees of severity. Exploration of the molecular pathological changes occurring in different cell types in SMA is crucial for developing new therapies. This study collected 39 human microarray datasets from ArrayExpress and GEO databases to build an integrative transcriptomic analysis for recognizing novel SMA targets. The transcriptomic analysis was conducted through combining weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) for gene module detection, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for functional categorization and filtration, and Cytoscape (visual interaction gene network analysis) for target gene identification. Seven novel target genes (Bmp4, Serpine1, Gata6, Ptgs2, Bcl2, IL6 and Cntn1) of SMA were revealed, and are all known in the regulation of TNFα for controlling neural, cardiac and bone development. Sequentially, the differentially expressed patterns of these 7 target genes in mouse tissues (e.g., spinal cord, heart, muscles and bone) were validated in SMA mice of different severities (pre-symptomatic, mildly symptomatic, and severely symptomatic). In severely symptomatic SMA mice, TNFα was up-regulated with attenuation of Bmp4 and increase of Serpine1 and Gata6 (a pathway in neural and cardiac development), but not in pre-symptomatic and mildly symptomatic SMA mice. The severely symptomatic SMA mice also had the elevated levels of Ptgs2 and Bcl2 (a pathway in skeletal development) as well as IL6 and Cntn1 (a pathway in nervous system development). Thus, the 7 genes identified in this study might serve as potential target genes for future investigations of disease pathogenesis and SMA therapy. ? 2016 Yang et al.

However, the relationship between urinary tract stone disease and IBS has never been addressed. We aimed to investigate the risk of suffering new-onset IBS after an initial urinary stone attack using a nationwide database. Methods A study group enrolled a total of 13,254 patients who were diagnosed with an initial urinary stone attack; a comparison group recruited 39,762 matched non-urinary stone participants during 2003 and 2007. We followed each patient for 3 years to determine new-onset IBS. We also used Cox proportional hazards models to analyze the risk of IBS between the study and comparison groups after modified by demographics, residence, patient characteristics and personal histories. Results The occurrence rates of IBS were 3.3% (n = 440) and 2.6% (n = 1,034) respectively in the study and comparison groups. A covariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of IBS in the study group that was 1.28 times greater (HR = 1.29, 95% CI, 1.15-1.44) than that in the comparison group was showed in the stratified Cox proportional analysis. The adjusted HRs of IBS did not decrease after considering demographics and past histories. The majority of IBS (30.5%) occurred within the first 6 months after the stone attack. Conclusion Patients with an initial urinary stone attack are at increased risk of developing new-onset IBS. The HRs of IBS did not decrease even after adjusting for patient demographics and past histories. Most importantly, 30.5% of IBS occurred within the first 6 months after the urinary stone attack. ? 2016 Lei et al.

Thoracic aortic dissection is usually caused by sudden deceleration resulting from a traffic accident or fall. Aortic injury after blunt trauma is a critical condition. This study reported the outcomes of endovascular repair of acute traumatic aortic dissection in patients at a district general hospital. Methods: In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of eight patients with acute traumatic aortic dissection after a blunt trauma who had undergone thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) between January 2012 and December 2015 at a district general hospital in Taiwan. Results: The median age of the patients was 49±22 years (range, 20-77 years), and 6 of the 8 (75%) patients were men. Five patients were involved in traffic accidents, and 3 patients had fallen from heights. The injury severity score (ISS) of the patients ranged from 17 to 66. In all patients, the aortic injury was located near the origin of the left subclavian artery (LSA). Four patients had seal ostium of subclavian artery, left. None of the patients developed paraplegia or lower extremity ischemia. Moreover, all patients had concomitant injuries, and no patients died postoperatively. Conclusions: Endovascular repair is a rapid and minimally invasive therapy for patients with traumatic aortic injury and is associated with favorable technical results. ?

However, it is not well known whether altered plasma AcylCN, and amino acid profiles are associated with albuminuria or diabetic nephropathy (DN) in T2D. Objective: The aim of this study was to elucidate alterations in plasma levels of AcylCNs and amino acids with respect to the T2D patients with various stages of albuminuria. Methods: We recruited 52 healthy subjects as control, and 156 T2D patients which were divided into 52 normoalbuminuria, 52 microalbuminuria, and 52 macroalbuminuria. Plasma 37 AcylCNs and 12 amino acids were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Results: We found that T2D with normoalbuminuria and microalbuminuria had lower shot-, medium-, and long-chain AcylCNs, whereas T2D with macroalbuminuria had higher short-and medium-chain AcylCNs and lower long-chain AcylCNs than healthy subjects. Moreover, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was a negative, independent and significant predictor of albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) levels (β?=??0.376, P?<?0.001), whereas plasma Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was significantly and positively associated with ACR levels (β?=?0.169, P?=?0.049). Furthermore, multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis revealed that isobutyrylcarnitine (C4) was a positive, independent, and significant predictor of ACR levels with higher odds of having T2D patients with progression normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria [OR?=?9.93, 95?% CI (3.51–28.05), P?<?0.001]. Conclusions: The findings suggest that plasma C4 may serve as a potential biomarker for the early stages of DN. ? 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Acylcarnitine; Amino acids; Diabetic nephropathy; Metabolomics; Type 2 diabetes,acylcarnitine; albumin; arginine; C reactive protein; carnitine derivative; cholesterol oxidase; citrulline; creatinine; glucose; glycine; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; isobutyrylcarnitine; isoleucine; leucine; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; methionine; ornithine; phenylalanine; triacylglycerol; tyrosine; unclassified drug; valine; adult; albuminuria; amino acid analysis; anthropometry; Article; blood pressure measurement; chemical analyzer; chemical reaction; colorimetry; controlled study; diabetic nephropathy; glomerulus filtration rate; human; lipid blood level; macroalbuminuria; major clinical study; microalbuminuria; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; tandem mass spectrometry; urinalysis,2-s2.0-84969974084

PPG sensors are widely used nowadays for noninvasive diagnosis due to their salient features such as low cost and easy-to-useness. PPG signal is known highly correlated with human skin condition and cardiovascular system health. A new readout circuit featuring high-bandwidth, low-noise and low-power is designed in this study to evaluate quantitatively the melanin content of human skin based on PPG signals with high accuracy. This new readout circuit is intended to convert and amplify the electric current of the photo diode in the PPG sensor to voltage signals, and then being further properly amplified to the full dynamic range of the chip circuit fabricated by the TSMC 0.18?μm process for maximum S/N ratios. The designed circuit has a front-end transimpedance amplifier (TIA), 60?dB in gain, with a degenerate resistor to perform a low noise less than 3??V/√Hz while operating by a 3.3?V supply. In related circuit designs, the mismatch in current sources caused by CMOS process variation is mitigated by a current steering digital-analog-converter (DAC) with least significant bit (LSB) corresponding to 1.25??A. Both TIA and DAC are designed with effort to render high accuracy in the digital outputs for the levels of sensed melanin.

However, in some TKI responders, the benefits of such targeted therapies are limited by the rapid development of resistance, and strategies to overcome this resistance are urgently needed. Studies of drug resistance in cancer cells typically involve long term in vitro induction to obtain stably acquired drug-resistant cells followed by elucidation of resistance mechanisms, but the immediate responses of cancer cells upon drug treatment have been ignored. The aim of this study was to investigate the immediate responses of NSCLC cells upon treatment with EGFR TKIs. Results: Both NSCLC cells, ie, PC9 and H1975, showed immediate enhanced adhesion-related responses as an apoptosis-countering mechanism upon first-time TKI treatment. By gene expression and pathway analysis, adhesion-related pathways were enriched in gefitinib-treated PC9 cells. Pathway inhibition by small-hairpin RNAs or small-molecule drugs revealed that within hours of EGFR TKI treatment, NSCLC cells used adhesion-related responses to combat the drugs. Importantly, we show here that the Src family inhibitor, dasatinib, dramatically inhibits cell adhesion-related response and greatly enhances the cell-killing effects of EGFR TKI (gefitinib for the PC9 cells; afatinib for the H1975 cells) in NSCLC cells, which would otherwise escape the TKI-induced apoptosis. Conclusion: Results from this study indicate that NSCLC cells can employ the adhesion response as a survival pathway to survive under EGFR-targeted therapy. Simultaneous targeting of EGFR signaling and adhesion pathways would further boost the efficacy of EGFR-targeted therapy in NSCLC. ? 2016 Wang et al.",Adhesion response; Cell stress response; Drug resistance; Gene set enrichment analysis,afatinib; cilengitide; dasatinib; epidermal growth factor receptor; gefitinib; protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor; short hairpin RNA; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cell adhesion; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; cell survival; controlled study; cytotoxicity; down regulation; drug efficacy; extracellular matrix; flow cytometry; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; glycosylation; human; human cell; microarray analysis; molecular weight; morphology; non small cell lung cancer; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA interference; signal transduction; upregulation,2-s2.0-84969567568

FOXO3a, a transcription factor of the forkhead family, triggers apoptosis, but the mechanistic details involved in EGFR-TKI resistance and cancer stemness remain largely unclear. Here, we observed that a high level of FOXO3a was correlated with EGFR mutation-independent EGFR-TKI sensitivity, the suppression of cancer stemness, and better progression-free survival in lung cancer patients. The suppression of FOXO3a obviously increased gefitinib resistance and enhanced the stem-like properties of lung cancer cells; consistent overexpression of FOXO3a in gefitinib-resistant lung cancer cells reduced these effects. Moreover, we identified that miR-155 targeted the 3'UTR of FOXO3a and was transcriptionally regulated by NF-?B, leading to repressed FOXO3a expression and increased gefitinib resistance, as well as enhanced cancer stemness of lung cancer in vitro and in vivo.

TEM examination showed that the DOX-loaded nanoparticles, termed D-PL/TG NPs, exhibited a unique core-shell configuration composed of multiple amphiphilic chitosan-lecithin reverse micelles as the core and a triglyceride shell as a physical barrier to improve the encapsulation efficiency and reduce the drug leakage. In addition, the D-PL/TG NPs with sodium dodecyl sulfate modification on the surface have enhanced stability in the GI tract and increased oral bioavailability of doxorubicin. In vitro transport studies performed on Caco-2 monolayers indicated that the D-PL/TG NPs enhanced the permeability of DOX in the Caco-2 monolayers by altering the transport pathway from passive diffusion to transcytosis. The in vivo intestinal absorption assay suggested that the D-PL/TG NPs were preferentially absorbed through the specialized membranous epithelial cells (M cells) of the Peyer's patches, resulting in a significant improvement (8-fold) in oral bioavailability compared to that of free DOX. The experimental outcomes in this work demonstrate that the D-PL/TG NPs provide an exciting opportunity for advances in the oral administration of drugs with poor bioavailability that are usually used in treating tough and chronic diseases.

Further integration of wireless and self-powered units is of practical importance for implantable bioelectronics. In this study, we developed biocompatible organic photovoltaics (OPVs) for serving as wireless electrical power supply units that can be operated under illumination with near-infrared (NIR) light, and organic bioelectronic interface (OBEI) electrode devices as neural stimulation electrodes. The OPV/OBEI integrated system is capable to provide electrical stimulation (ES) as a means of enhancing neuron-like PC12 cell differentiation and neurite outgrowth. For the OPV design, we prepared devices incorporating two photoactive material systems - β-carotene/N,N′-dioctyl-3,4,9,10-perylenedicarboximide (β-carotene/PTCDI-C8) and poly(3-hexylthiophene)/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT/PCBM) - that exhibited open circuit voltages of 0.11 and 0.49 V, respectively, under NIR light LED (NLED) illumination. Then, we connected OBEI devices with different electrode gaps, incorporating biocompatible poly(hydroxymethylated-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), to OPVs to precisely tailor the direct current electric field conditions during the culturing of PC12 cells. This NIR light-driven OPV/OBEI system could be engineered to provide tunable control over the electric field (from 220 to 980 mV mm-1) to promote 64% enhancement in the neurite length, direct the neurite orientation on chips, or both. The OPV/OBEI integrated systems under NIR illumination appear to function as effective power delivery platforms that should meet the requirements for wirelessly offering medical ES to a portion of the nervous system; they might also be a key technology for the development of next-generation implantable bioelectronics. ? 2016 American Chemical Society.",bioelectronic medicines; electrical stimulation; organic bioelectronic interfaces; organic photovoltaics; wireless,Biocompatibility; Butyric acid; Electric fields; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission; Electrodes; Electrophysiology; Infrared devices; Integrated control; Open circuit voltage; Radio; Bio-electronic interface; Bioelectronic systems; Direct current electric fields; Electrical power supply; Electrical stimulations; Organic photovoltaics; Photoactive materials; Poly (3-hexylthiophene); Light emitting diodes; biomaterial; imide; organoselenium derivative; perylene; perylenediimide; poly(3-hexyl)selenophene; analogs and derivatives; animal; cell differentiation; chemistry; electrotherapy; human; neurite; neurite outgrowth; PC12 cell line; physiology; power supply; procedures; radiation response; rat; wireless communication; Animals; Biocompatible Materials; Cell Differentiation; Electric Power Supplies; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Humans; Imides; Neurites; Neuronal Outgrowth; Organoselenium Compounds; PC12 Cells; Perylene; Rats; Wireless Technology,2-s2.0-84964914250

However, the molecular mechanism of astaxanthin-induced cytotoxicity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells has not been identified. Rad51 plays a central role in homologous recombination, and studies show that chemo-resistant carcinomas exhibit high levels of Rad51 expression. In this study, astaxanthin treatment inhibited cell viability and proliferation of two NSCLC cells, A549 and H1703. Astaxanthin treatment (2.5-20 μM) decreased Rad51 expression and phospho-AKT(Ser473) protein level in a time and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, expression of constitutively active AKT (AKT-CA) vector rescued the decreased Rad51 mRNA and protein levels in astaxanthin-treated NSCLC cells. Combined treatment with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors (LY294002 or wortmannin) further decreased the Rad51 expression in astaxanthin-exposed A549 and H1703 cells. Knockdown of Rad51 expression by transfection with si-Rad51 RNA or cotreatment with LY294002 further enhanced the cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition of astaxanthin. Additionally, mitomycin C (MMC) as an anti-tumor antibiotic is widely used in clinical NSCLC chemotherapy. Combination of MMC and astaxanthin synergistically resulted in cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition in NSCLC cells, accompanied with reduced phospho-AKT(Ser473) level and Rad51 expression. Overexpression of AKT-CA or Flag-tagged Rad51 reversed the astaxanthin and MMC-induced synergistic cytotoxicity. In contrast, pretreatment with LY294002 further decreased the cell viability in astaxanthin and MMC co-treated cells. In conclusion, astaxanthin enhances MMC-induced cytotoxicity by decreasing Rad51 expression and AKT activation. These findings may provide rationale to combine astaxanthin with MMC for the treatment of NSCLC. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we describe the preparation of polycrystalline silicon nanowire field-effect transistors (pSNWFETs) that serve as biosensing devices for biomarker detection. A protocol for chemical and biomolecular sensing by using pSNWFETs is presented. The pSNWFET device was demonstrated to be a promising transducer for real-time, label-free, and ultra-high-sensitivity biosensing applications. The source/drain channel conductivity of a pSNWFET is sensitive to changes in the environment around its silicon nanowire (SNW) surface. Thus, by immobilizing probes on the SNW surface, the pSNWFET can be used to detect various biotargets ranging from small molecules (dopamine) to macromolecules (DNA and proteins). Immobilizing a bioprobe on the SNW surface, which is a multistep procedure, is vital for determining the specificity of the biosensor. It is essential that every step of the immobilization procedure is correctly performed. We verified surface modifications by directly observing the shift in the electric properties of the pSNWFET following each modification step. Additionally, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to examine the surface composition following each modification. Finally, we demonstrated DNA sensing on the pSNWFET. This protocol provides step-by-step procedures for verifying bioprobe immobilization and subsequent DNA biosensing application. ? 2016 Journal of Visualized Experiments.",Bioengineering; Biosensing; Charge-charge interaction; Issue 110; Label-free; Nanowire field-effect transistor; Polysilicon; Real-time detection; Surface modification,"DNA; DNA probe; nanowire; protein; silicon; chemistry; devices; DNA probe; genetic procedures; human; procedures; transistor; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Biosensing Techniques; DNA; DNA Probes; Humans; Nanowires; Photoelectron Spectroscopy; Proteins; Silicon; Transistors, Electronic",2-s2.0-84964894033

A PtIV prodrug (HSPt) derived from functionalization of cisplatin with hydroxyl and succinate is conjugated with a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-modified SPION for cancer therapy and monitoring of therapeutic responses. The relaxivity of HSPt-PEG-SPIONs is larger than that of commercial contrast agent Feridex, and a tumor-selective negative contrast is observed in MRI in a magnetic field. HSPt-PEG-SPIONs can be dissociated and reduced into PtII species by glutathione (GSH). Instead of forming DNA-Pt crosslinks, the reduced product induces direct DNA single- or double-strand breaks, which is uncommon for Pt drugs. The cytotoxicity of HSPt-PEG-SPIONs is positively correlated with the GSH level of tumor cells, which is opposite to the scenario of current Pt drugs. HSPt-PEG-SPIONs are as cytotoxic as cisplatin against cancer cells but are almost nontoxic towards normal cells. Since the mechanism of action of the nanocomposite is different from the established paradigm for Pt drugs, it may become a special theranostic agent for cancer treatment. ?

However, the midterm outcome for patients undergoing this procedure varies considerably with baseline characteristics. To determine the impact of baseline characteristics on outcomes following carotid artery stenting, data from 107 eligible patients with a first episode of ischemic stroke were collected by retrospective chart review. A modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used to divide patients into two baseline groups, mRS ?2 and mRS >2. A three-step decision-tree statistical analysis was conducted. After weighting the decision-tree parameters, the following impact hierarchy was obtained: admission low-density lipoprotein, gouty arthritis, chronic kidney disease, ipsilateral common carotid artery resistance index, contralateral ophthalmic artery resistance index, sex, and dyslipidemia. The finite-state machine model demonstrated that, in patients with baseline mRS ?2, 46% had an improved mRS score at follow-up, whereas 54% had a stable mRS score. In patients with baseline mRS >2, a stable mRS score was observed in 75%, improved score in 23%, and a poorer score in 2%. Admission low-density lipoprotein was the strongest predictive factor influencing poststenting outcome. In addition, our study provides further evidence that carotid artery stenting can be of benefit in first-time ischemic stroke patients with baseline mRS scores >2. ? 2016 Yu et al.",Carotid artery stenting; Finite-state machine; Ischemic stroke; Modified rankin scale; Resistance index,low density lipoprotein; aged; artery resistance; Article; brain ischemia; carotid artery stenting; chronic kidney disease; clinical effectiveness; common carotid artery; dyslipidemia; female; gout; hospital admission; human; major clinical study; male; medical decision making; medical record review; ophthalmic artery; Rankin scale; sex difference; treatment outcome,2-s2.0-84962376108

In contrast, miR-30a overexpression reversed the mesenchymal appearance of cancer cells to result in a cobblestone-like epithelial phenotype. We identified Slug, one of the master regulators of EMT, as a target of miR-30a using in silico prediction. Reporter assays indicated that miR-30a could bind to the 3'-untranslted region of Slug mRNA. Furthermore, we linked miR-30a to increased expression of claudins, a family of tight junction transmembrane proteins. An interaction between Slug and E-box in the claudin promoter sequences was reduced upon miR-30a overexpression, further leading to reduction of filopodia formation and decreased invasiveness/metastasis capabilities of breast cancer cells. Consistently, delivery of miR-30a in xenografted mice decreased tumor invasion and migration. In patients with breast cancer, a significantly elevated risk of the miR-30alow/CLDN2low/FSCNhigh genotype was observed, linking to a phenotypic manifestation of larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and advanced tumor stage among patients.

To enable controlled drug release and enhance the blood-brain barrier (BBB)-crossing efficiency for brain tumor therapy, a new dual-targeting magnetic polydiacetylene nanocarriers (PDNCs) delivery system modified with lactoferrin (Lf) is developed. The PDNCs are synthesized using the ultraviolet (UV) cross-linkable 10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid (PCDA) monomers through spontaneous assembling onto the surface of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles to form micelles-polymerized structures. The results demonstrate that PDNCs will reduce the drug leakage and further control the drug release, and display self-responsive fluorescence upon intracellular uptake for cell trafficking and imaging-guided tumor treatment. The magnetic Lf-modified PDNCs with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dual-targeting ability can enhance the transportation of the PDNCs across the BBB for tracking and targeting gliomas. An enhanced therapeutic efficiency can be obtained using Lf-Cur (Curcumin)-PDNCs by improving the retention time of the encapsulated Cur and producing fourfold higher Cur amounts in the brain compared to free Cur. Animal studies also confirm that Lf targeting and controlled release act synergistically to significantly suppress tumors in orthotopic brain-bearing rats. ? 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Usually, nurses are the primary workers who perform community health promotion; however, because of the chronic shortage of working nurses, many Taiwan hospitals have closed wards and deferred the responsibility of promoting primary prevention. With a community health promotion platform integrating interactive response features and Web sites for community patients and hospital staff, a case hospital efficiently sustained the community health services. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the integrated community health promotion platform for conducting education. Fifty-four patients/residents were invited to join a quasi-experiment of health education, and a follow-up survey was conducted to assess the acceptance of the community health promotion platform from both the experimental group of learners/users and the hospital staff. The results showed that the community health promotion platform was effective in improving participant health awareness.

Rhodamine 6G (R6G) as a Raman reporter is then encapsulated into the nanochannels and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is conjugated on the nanocomposite surface, defined as anti-EGFR-PEG-rGO@CPSS-Au-R6G, where PEG is polyethylene glycol and CPSS is carbon porous silica nanosheets. SERS spectra results show that rGO@CPSS-Au-R6G enhances 5 × 106 magnification of the Raman signals and thus can be applied in the noninvasive cell tracking. Furthermore, it displays high sensitivity (detection limits: 10-8m R6G solution) due to the ""hot spots"" effects by the arrangements of AuNPs in the nanochannels of mesoporous silica.

High photothermal therapy efficiency with a low power density (0.5 W cm-2) of near-infrared laser can be achieved because of the synergistic effect by conjugated AuNPs and rGO nanosheets.

SGCA encodes alpha-sarcoglycan (SG) that forms a heterotetramer with other SGs in the sarcolemma, and comprises part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. The frequency of LGMD2D is variable among different ethnic backgrounds, and so far only a few patients have been reported in Asia. We identified five patients with a novel homozygous mutation of c.101G > T (p.Arg34Leu) in SGCA from a big aboriginal family ethnically consisting of two tribes in Taiwan. Patient 3 is the maternal uncle of patients 1 and 2. All their parents, heterozygous for c.101G > T, denied consanguineous marriages although they were from the same tribe. The heterozygous parents of patients 4 and 5 were from two different tribes, originally residing in different geographic regions in Taiwan. Haplotype analysis showed that all five patients shared the same mutation-associated haplotype, indicating the probability of a founder effect and consanguinity. The results suggest that the carrier rate of c.101G > T in SGCA may be high in Taiwan, especially in the aboriginal population regardless of the tribes.

In this study, a practical approach to living polymerization of functionalized thermoresponsive monomers enabled the incorporation of self-constituted multiple hydrogen bonded groups into micelles that have potential as supramolecular drug-delivery systems. Phase transitions and morphological studies in aqueous solution showed that the microstructure can be controlled to achieve well-defined vesicle-like micelles with respect to the strength of the hydrogen bond segment. Thus, the resulting micelles have a very low critical micellization concentration and very high loading capacity (16.1%), making the loading process extremely stable and efficient. Incorporation of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) affected the micellization process in aqueous solution and enabled fine-tuning of drug loading and precise control of drug release rate with excellent sensitivity. Release studies in vitro showed that DOX-loaded micelles exerted dose-dependent cytotoxicity against human liver carcinoma (HepG2) cells at the physiological temperature of 37 °C. In addition, DOX-loaded micelles were efficiently endocytosed by the cancer cells, which may enable the micelles to serve as suitable vehicles for effective delivery of anticancer drugs to primary tumors and metastatic disease. This newly developed material may provide a potential route towards next-generation drug delivery vehicles. Statement of Significance A breakthrough innovation in water-based thermo-responsive polymers has enabled significant progress in developing smart stimuli-responsive nanocarriers by generating novel ""supramolecular polymeric micelles"" via self-complementary hydrogen-bonding interactions. These newly developed micelles exhibit extremely high micellar stability and drug loading capacity (up to 16%), excellent thermo-responsive behavior and precise control of drug release rate due to hydrogen-bond-induced physical cross-linking. In addition, doxorubicin-loaded micelles were efficiently endocytosed by the cancer cells, which allows them to serve as suitable vehicles for effective delivery of anticancer drugs to primary tumors and metastatic disease. Thus, this work provides a potential route for the development of next generation multifunctional nanocarriers that have improved safety and to increase the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer therapy. ?2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

Sulforaphane (SFN) is an antioxidant phytocompound that acts against cellular oxidative stress and tumorigenesis. However, there is little known about its anti-viral activity. In this study, we demonstrated that SFN significantly suppressed HCV protein and RNA levels in HCV replicon cells and infectious system, with an IC50 value of 5.7 ± 0.2 μM. Moreover, combination of SFN with anti-viral drugs displayed synergistic effects in the suppression of HCV replication. In addition, we found nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/HO-1 induction in response to SFN and determined the signaling pathways involved in this process, including inhibition of NS3 protease activity and induction of IFN response. In contrast, the anti-viral activities were attenuated by knockdown of HO-1 with specific inhibitor (SnPP) and shRNA, suggesting that anti-HCV activity of SFN is dependent on HO-1 expression. Otherwise, SFN stimulated the phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) leading Nrf2-mediated HO-1 expression against HCV replication. Overall, our results indicated that HO-1 is essential in SFN-mediated anti-HCV activity and provide new insights in the molecular mechanism of SFN in HCV replication. ? 2016 Yu et al.

To provide insights into brain dynamics associated with MS, this study recruited 19 subjects to participate in an electroencephalogram (EEG) experiment in a virtual-reality driving environment. When riding on consecutive winding roads, subjects experienced postural instability and sensory conflict between visual and vestibular stimuli. Meanwhile, subjects rated their level of MS on a six-point scale. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to separate the filtered EEG signals into maximally temporally independent components (ICs). Then, reduced logarithmic spectra of ICs of interest, using principal component analysis, were decomposed by ICA again to find spectrally fixed and temporally independent modulators (IMs). Results demonstrated that a higher degree of MS accompanied increased activation of alpha (r = 0.421) and gamma (r = 0.478) IMs across remote-independent brain processes, covering motor, parietal and occipital areas. This co-modulatory spectral change in alpha and gamma bands revealed the neurophysiological demand to regulate conflicts among multi-modal sensory systems during MS. ?

To minimize complications such as organ degeneration, diabetic patients are required to undergo treatments to maintain the blood glucose level in the normal range, ideally mimicking normal insulin secretion. The normal physiological insulin secretion pattern in healthy individuals consists of a base (basal) level through the day and increased secretion after meals (bolus insulin). Thus effective treatments may combine long acting, low-level insulin therapy with boosts of short acting insulin and/or oral agents. To achieve long term management of basal insulin level, an injectable insulin-loaded gel composed of self-assembled nanoparticles from carboxymethyl-hexanoyl chitosan (CHC) and integrated lysozyme for controlled biodegradation and insulin release was developed. In vitro characterizations and evaluations confirmed that lysozyme was active on CHC and that the amount of lysozyme in a CHC hydrogel determined the degradation and insulin release rate. The degradation products were found to be highly cytocompatible using a cell assay. In vivo evaluation of the system in a diabetic mouse model revealed that the fasted blood glucose level could be maintained in the normal range for 10 days with a single injection of insulin-loaded CHC-lysozyme gel. The insulin-loaded CHC-lysozyme gels clearly show promise for use as a novel injectable long-acting insulin delivery system, with potential to manage the basal insulin level for many days with a single injection. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, [1] has specified the dimming frequency, fDIM, larger than 3kHz to achieve a no-observable-effect flicker level. State-of-the-art LED drivers employ the SIMO topology with four channels in Fig. 12.7.1, to deliver energy to each LED using the time-multiplexing (TM) control technique [2-4], in which the luminance is controlled by the dimming signals. Two major shortcomings for such approaches are: (1) Sequential dimming signals; and (2) Current cross-regulation (CCR) effects. In [2], the LED drivers with TM control result in only 9b color resolution at the dimming frequency of 1.5kHz, which may cause flicker hazard. Besides, the complete white-red-green-blue (WRGB) sequence needs a total of four switching periods to light up the 4 LEDs separately. On the other hand, due to inherent rising and falling delay of the hysteretic current control (HCC) circuit, tdr and tdf respectively, the CCR effect seriously affects the accuracy of the controller when the inductor current slope is varied. For example, with L=15μH, VIN=20V, VR=2.5V, VG=3.5V, tdr=300ns and tdf=250ns, the SIMO will result in 4% CCR between Iavg,R and Iavg,G when the average LED current is 1A. More specifically, with the same color in the sequence, voltage regulation may be disregarded when regulated constant current through the sensing resistor RSEN is used as a negative feedback control. However, when different colors are in sequence, where VO, =VR, VG, VB, or VW, are different, large voltage cross-regulation (VCR) across the RSEN occurs and so does the CCR. The CCR effects become an open question for enhancing LED current accuracy. For alleviating the CCR effect, the discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) has been applied for TM control in [3]. However, with the limited output current in DCM, low output power resulted and large output capacitors were required to suppress the VCR. ? 2016 IEEE.",,Color; Delay circuits; Feedback; Luminance; Reconfigurable hardware; Voltage regulators; Color resolution; Constant current; Control techniques; Discontinuous conduction mode; Hysteretic current control; Inductor currents; Switching period; Time multiplexing; Light emitting diodes,2-s2.0-84962798423

However, using tamoxifen routinely to inhibit endogenous or exogenous estrogen effects is occasionally difficult because of its potential side effects. Objectives: The aim of this study is to design a local drug delivery system to encapsulate tamoxifen for observing their efficacy of skin penetration, drug accumulation and cancer therapy. Methods: A cationic liposome-PEG-PEI complex (LPPC) was used as a carrier for the encapsulation of tamoxifen and forming 'LPPC/TAM' for transdermal release. The cytotoxicity of LPPC/TAM was analyzed by MTT. The skin penetration, tumor growth inhibition and organ damages were measured in xenograft mice following transdermal treatment. Results: LPPC/TAM had an average size less than 270nm and a zeta-potential of approximately 40mV. LPPC/TAM displayed dramatically increased the cytotoxic activity in all breast cancer cells, especially in ER-positive breast cancer cells. In vivo, LPPC drug delivery helped the fluorescent dye penetrating across the skim and accumulating rapidly in tumor area. Administration of LPPC/TAM by transdermal route inhibited about 86% of tumor growth in mice bearing BT474 tumors. This local treatment of LPPC/TAM did not injury skin and any organs. Conclusion: LPPC-delivery system provided a better skin penetration and drug accumulation and therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, LPPC/TAM drug delivery maybe a useful transdermal tool of drugs utilization for breast cancer therapy. ? 2016 Lin et al.",Breast cancer; Lipo-PEG-PEI complex; Tamoxifen; Transdermal treatment,"Cells; Cytotoxicity; Diseases; Drug interactions; Liposomes; Mammals; Oncology; Tumors; Breast Cancer; Breast cancer cells; Cytotoxic activities; Lipo-peg-pei complexes; Local drug delivery; Tamoxifen; Therapeutic efficacy; Transdermal; Drug therapy; lipoplex; liposome; tamoxifen; liposome; macrogol derivative; poly(ethylene glycol)-co-poly(ethyleneimine); polyethyleneimine; tamoxifen; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; breast cancer; breast cancer cell line; cancer inhibition; controlled study; drug accumulation; drug cytotoxicity; drug dosage form comparison; drug efficacy; drug penetration; drug release; drug safety; encapsulation; estrogen receptor positive breast cancer; human; human cell; in vivo study; mouse; MTT assay; nonhuman; skin penetration; transdermal drug delivery system; tumor xenograft; zeta potential; analogs and derivatives; animal; breast; Breast Neoplasms; cell proliferation; cutaneous drug administration; drug delivery system; drug effects; female; HEK293 cell line; MCF-7 cell line; nude mouse; procedures; tumor cell line; Administration, Cutaneous; Animals; Breast; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Drug Delivery Systems; Female; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Liposomes; MCF-7 Cells; Mice; Mice, Nude; Polyethylene Glycols; Polyethyleneimine; Tamoxifen",2-s2.0-84959355232

In this paper, we design and develop an interactive system of virtual healthcare assistant to help people, especially for those who suffer from chronic diseases (e.g., metabolic syndrome) to easily understand their health conditions and then well manage it. This system analyzes the result of regular physical examination to evaluate the health risk and provide personalized healthcare services for users in terms of diet and exercise guideline recommendations. We developed some interactive ways for users to easily feedback their vital signs to the system and quickly get the suggestions for health management from the system. Besides the browser-based system, we also developed a mobile App that can regularly remind users to carry out the recommendations, which are provided by the system. To prove the system is feasible in the real-world clinical environment, we also applied the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for a human subject research to validate this system. Other than the functional features, there are also several important non-functional features of the extensibility and the convenience for use. First, we use the physical examination result as the raw data to be analyzed. It's very convenient for users with very low cost. Second, the system design is extendable, so it can be easily adjusted to work for any chronic ills, even other kinds of diseases. Moreover, it can be extended to provide other kinds of healthcare guideline recommendations as well.

Currently, two new β-lactamase inhibitors, namely avibactam and MK-7655, are under development for clinical use in the treatment of cIAIs. Eravacycline, a novel, fully synthetic tetracycline-class drug, has been shown in Phase II and III clinical trials to be more potent than tigecycline against a significant number of multidrug-resistant organisms causing cIAIs. Plazomicin, a next-generation aminoglycoside, is a promising agent for treatment of cIAIs due to multidrug-resistant pathogens. Of the recently developed quinolones, delafloxacin and finafloxacin have been shown to be effective against pathogens that survive and multiply in mildly acidic environments, although further clinical studies examining their clinical utility in the treatment of cIAIs are warranted. Oritavancin, a new semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide agent, has been demonstrated to be a potent antibiotic in the treatment of cIAIs due to drug-resistant Gram-positive organisms. Several other new antibiotics in development also show promise and will hopefully broaden the possibilities for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections due to MDR pathogens. ? 2015 Taylor & Francis.",Antibiotics; Delafloxacin; Eravacycline; ESBL-MDR-XDR Gramnegatives; Finafloxacin; Intra-abdominal infections; New ?-lactamase inhibitor combinations; Plazomicin,"amikacin; antibiotic agent; avibactam; aztreonam; carbapenem derivative; ceftaroline; ceftazidime; ceftolozane; delafloxacin; eravacycline; ertapenem; finafloxacin; imipenem; oritavancin; oxazolidinone derivative; plazomicin; polypeptide antibiotic agent; relebactam; tazobactam; tigecycline; antiinfective agent; beta lactamase inhibitor; drug combination; abdominal infection; Acinetobacter; antibiotic resistance; Bacteroides fragilis; Candida; carbapenem resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa; carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae; drug efficacy; extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Escherichia coli; extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; hospital infection; infection risk; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; microbiology; mortality rate; multicenter study (topic); phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); Pseudomonas aeruginosa; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; Streptococcus; vancomycin resistant Enterococcus; antibiotic resistance; drug combination; Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections; human; Intraabdominal Infections; multidrug resistance; Anti-Bacterial Agents; beta-Lactamase Inhibitors; Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic; Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic; Drug Combinations; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections; Humans; Intraabdominal Infections",2-s2.0-84957939636

Methods: This 6-year retrospective study included three medical centers with similar facilities and infection control measures in Taiwan. These hospitals used different types of ASPs: one had a hospital-wide preauthorization requirement by infectious diseases physicians for all broad-spectrum antibiotics, covering all intensive care units; the second used the same program, but excluded all intensive care units; and the third used postprescription review only. The nonsusceptibility of unduplicated isolates of gram-negative bacilli causing health care-associated infections and consumption of broad-spectrum antibiotics were analyzed. Results: Overall, the usage of broad-spectrum antibiotics of all classes escalated significantly over time in all three hospitals, but consumption was lowest under the hospital-wide preauthorization program. Under this ASP, despite a 2-fold increase in the total broad-spectrum antibiotic consumption during study period, some declining trends of resistance were found, including ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa. By contrast, the other two hospitals with preauthorization program excluding all intensive care units and postprescription review had similar high broad-spectrum antibiotic consumption, comparable growing trends of resistant strains in general, and the correlations of antibiotic consumption and resistance were basically positive. Carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii increased significantly over time in all three hospitals. Conclusion: This interhospital comparison suggested that hospital-wide preauthorization program is the most effective to reduce key gram-negative bacilli resistance, with the exception of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. ? 2015.",Antibiotic consumption; Antibiotic stewardship program; Carbapenem; Gram-negative organisms; Multidrug-resistant organisms,"antibiotic agent; beta lactam antibiotic; beta lactamase inhibitor; carbapenem; carbapenem derivative; cefepime; cephalosporin derivative; ciprofloxacin; piperacillin plus tazobactam; polypeptide antibiotic agent; quinolone derivative; tigecycline; antiinfective agent; Acinetobacter baumannii; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic therapy; antimicrobial stewardship program; Article; bacterial strain; bacterium isolate; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug use; Gram negative bacterium; health program; healthcare associated infection; hospital; human; infection control; intensive care unit; major clinical study; multicenter study; prescription; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; retrospective study; Taiwan; clinical trial; cross infection; drug effects; drug utilization; Gram negative bacterium; Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections; health care policy; isolation and purification; microbiology; organizational policy; prevalence; standards; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Cross Infection; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Drug Utilization; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections; Health Policy; Hospitals; Humans; Organizational Policy; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan",2-s2.0-84958061022

Proponents of the systemic approach to road safety management suggest that it is more effective in reducing crash frequency than the traditional hot spot approach. The systemic approach aims to identify SWiPs by crash type(s) and, therefore, effectively connects crashes to their corresponding countermeasures. Nevertheless, a major challenge to implementing this approach is the low precision of crash frequency models, which results from the systemic approach considering subsets (crash types) of total crashes leading to higher variability in modeling outcomes. This study responds to the need for more precise statistical output and proposes a multivariate spatial model for simultaneously modeling crash frequencies for different crash types. The multivariate spatial model not only induces a multivariate correlation structure between crash types at the same site, but also spatial correlation among adjacent sites to enhance model precision. This study utilized crash, traffic, and roadway inventory data on rural two-lane highways in Pennsylvania to construct and test the multivariate spatial model. Four models with and without the multivariate and spatial correlations were tested and compared. The results show that the model that considers both multivariate and spatial correlation has the best fit. Moreover, it was found that the multivariate correlation plays a stronger role than the spatial correlation when modeling crash frequencies in terms of different crash types. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, the camera-based photoplethysmography techniques have been proposed for HR measurement. These techniques allow us to estimate the HR contactlessly with low-cost camera. However, the previous works showed limit success for estimating HRV because the R-R intervals, the primary data for HRV calculation, are sensitive to noise and artifacts. Methods: This paper proposed a non-contact method to extract the blood volume pulse signal using a chrominance-based method followed by a proposed CWT-based denoising technique. The R-R intervals can then be obtained by finding the peaks in the denoised signal. In this paper, we taped 12 video clips using the frontal camera of a smart phone with different scenarios to make comparisons among our method and the other alternatives using the absolute errors between the estimated HRV metrics and the ones obtained by an ECG-accurate chest band. Results: As shown in experiments, our algorithm can greatly reduce absolute errors of HRV metrics comparing with the related works using RGB color signals. The mean of absolute errors of HRV metrics from our method is only 3.53 ms for the static-subject video clips. Conclusions: The proposed camera-based method is able to produce reliable HRV metrics which are close to the ones measured by contact devices under different conditions. Thus, our method can be used for remote health monitoring in a convenient and comfortable way. ? 2016 Huang and Dung.",Blood volume pulse; Cardiac physiology; Heart rate variability; Non-contact photoplethysmography,Blood; Cameras; Errors; Heart; Hemodynamics; Photoplethysmography; Physiological models; Physiology; Signal denoising; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Video cameras; Blood volume pulse; Cardiac physiology; De-noising techniques; Heart rate variability; Non-contact; Noncontact methods; Physiological data; Remote health monitoring; Biomedical signal processing; adult; algorithm; Article; artifact reduction; continuous wavelet transform; electrocardiography; female; heart rate variability; human; intermethod comparison; male; measurement accuracy; measurement error; photoelectric plethysmography; priority journal; remote sensing; RR interval; smartphone; videorecording; wavelet analysis; young adult; devices; heart function test; heart rate; movement (physiology); signal noise ratio; Adult; Algorithms; Female; Heart Function Tests; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Movement; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; Smartphone; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84957309625

Discrimination of OSCC tissues is automatically and objectively made by spectral matching comparison of the MCR decomposed Raman spectra and the standard Raman spectrum of keratin, a well-established molecular marker of OSCC. We use a total of 24 tissue samples, 10 OSCC and 10 normal tissues from the same 10 patients, 3 OSCC and 1 normal tissues from different patients. Following the newly developed protocol presented here, we have been able to detect OSCC tissues with 77 to 92% sensitivity (depending on how to define positivity) and 100% specificity.

However, previous oncological studies mainly focused on the splicing of individual genes. Whether and how transcript isoforms are coordinated to affect cellular functions remain underexplored. Also of great interest is how the splicing regulome cooperates with the transcription regulome to facilitate tumorigenesis. The answers to these questions are of fundamental importance to cancer biology. Results: Here, we report a comparative study between the transcript-based network (TN) and the gene-based network (GN) derived from the transcriptomes of paired tumor–normal tissues from 77 lung adenocarcinoma patients. We demonstrate that the two networks differ significantly from each other in terms of patient clustering and the number and functions of network modules. Interestingly, the majority (89.5%) of multi-transcript genes have their transcript isoforms distributed in at least two TN modules, suggesting regulatory and functional divergences between transcript isoforms. Furthermore, TN and GN modules share only ~50%–60% of their biological functions. TN thus appears to constitute a regulatory layer separate from GN. Nevertheless, our results indicate that functional convergence and divergence both occur between TN and GN, implying complex interactions between the two regulatory layers. Finally, we report that the expression profiles of module members in both TN and GN shift dramatically yet concordantly during tumorigenesis. The mechanisms underlying this coordinated shifting remain unclear yet are worth further explorations. Conclusion: We show that in lung adenocarcinoma, transcript isoforms per se are coordinately regulated to conduct biological functions not conveyed by the network of genes. However, the two networks may interact closely with each other by sharing the same or related biological functions. Unraveling the effects and mechanisms of such interactions will significantly advance our understanding of this deadly disease. ? 2016 Hsu et al .",Alternative splicing; Gene network; Lung adenocarcinoma; Module; Transcriptional regulation; Transcriptome analysis,Article; cancer genetics; cancer staging; female; gene expression profiling; gene ontology; gene regulatory network; genetic association; genetic code; genetic regulation; genetic transcription; human; human tissue; lung adenocarcinoma; lung carcinogenesis; major clinical study; male; molecular genetics; onset age; RNA sequence; smoking habit; transcript based network; transcription regulation,2-s2.0-84955054955

Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) has been the most frequently studied SILS to date. Hundreds of studies on SILC have failed to present conclusive results. Most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been small in scale and have been conducted under ideal operative conditions. The role of SILC in complicated scenarios remains uncertain. As common bile duct exploration (CBDE) methods have been used for more than one hundred years, laparoscopic CBDE (LCBDE) has emerged as an effective, demanding, and infrequent technique employed during the laparoscopic era. Likewise, laparoscopic biliary-enteric anastomosis is difficult to carry out, with only a few studies have been published on the approach. The application of SILS to CBDE and biliary-enteric anastomosis is extremely rare, and such innovative procedures are only carried out by a number of specialized groups across the globe. Herein we present a thorough and detailed analysis of SILC in terms of operative techniques, training and learning curves, safety and efficacy levels, recovery trends, and costs by reviewing RCTs conducted over the past three years and two recently updated meta-analyses.

Although dysregulated lipid metabolism results in diabetic nephropathy (DN) development in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), it is not understood whether betatrophin is associated with urinary albumin excretion and renal function. Methods: Based on albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), 109 T2DM patients were divided into normoalbuminuria (ACR <30mg/g), microalbuminuria (ACR between 30 and 300mg/g), and macroalbuminuria (ACR > 300mg/g). Serum betatrophin levels of 109 T2DM patients and 32 healthy subjects were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: Serum level of betatrophin was significantly increased in T2DM patients with normoalbuminuria, microalbuminuria, and macroalbuminuria as compared with healthy subjects (P < 0.001). Serum betatrophin level was positively correlated with sex, duration of diabetes, systolic blood pressure (SBP), body mass index (BMI), ACR, and triglyceride, whereas it was inversely correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (P < 0.001). Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis showed the betatrophin was significantly and positively independent with triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (P < 0.05), whereas it was inversely independent with eGFR, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (P < 0.05). In addition, the betatrophin had higher odds of having DN [odds ratio (OR) = 5.65, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2.17-14.57, P < 0.001]. Conclusion: Betatrophin is significantly increased in T2DM patients with different stages of albuminuria.

Critical functions within green supply chain management are internal improvements and selection of green suppliers. This study proposes a novel, hybrid model that addresses dependent relationships between various criteria and the vague information coming from decision-makers. The Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) technique structures the relationships among criteria, thereby constructing an influential network relationship map (INRM). Meanwhile the DEMATEL-based, analytical network process (ANP) method aids in obtaining influential weights of the criteria. Decision-makers may hold diverse opinions and preferences due to incomplete information, differences in knowledge or simply conflicts that are inherent between various departments. This can make it difficult to judge the performance of alternatives. One remedy is to apply a modified COmplex PRoportional ASsessment of alternatives with Grey relations. Next, this is applied to improve each criterion for integration of the performance values obtained in closing the aspiration level from different expert opinions based on INRM. An empirical example using data from a Taiwanese electronics company is provided to demonstrate our proposed method. The results can provide firms with a knowledge-based understanding of the source of some problems, thus reducing the performance gaps and closing the aspiration levels. Finally, there is a discussion on certain managerial implications. ? 2015 Taylor and Francis.",analytic network process (ANP); COmplex PRoportional ASsessment of alternatives with Grey relations (modified COPRAS-G); DEMATEL-based ANP (DANP); green supply chain management (GSCM); multi-attribute decision-making (MADM),Chains; Complex networks; Knowledge based systems; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Analytic network process; DEMATEL; Green supply chain management; Grey relation; Multi attribute decision making; Decision making,2-s2.0-84954362436

After reviewing the diagnostic criteria and related assessment tools from the threeaspects of “substance abuse”, “impulsive control disorder” and “problematic internet use”,wealso included the compensatory use and neuropsychological /neuroimaging research findingsto obtain a picture of how the diagnostic indicators developed. We found that there were many psychiatric disordersassociated with internet addiction, butits diagnostic indicators cannot be developed solely based on the perspective of mental disorder. The psychometric properties of the assessment tools were validicated by many studies, but no concensus have been reached.

We recruited 30 patients with unilateral or bilateral diabetic ulcerated feet in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chia-Yi Branch, from October 2012 to December 2013. Real-time dorsal foot skin perfusion pressures (SPPs) before and after Buerger exercise were measured and analyzed. In addition, the severity of ischemia and the presence of ulcers before exercise were also stratified. A total of 30 patients with a mean age of 63.4 ± 13.7 years old were enrolled in this study.

Forty Wistar rats with postcardiac arrest acidosis (blood pH < 7.2) were included. They were divided into study (500 mg/kg L-alanyl-L-glutamine, n=20) and control (normal saline, n=20) groups. Each of the rats received resuscitation. The outcomes were compared between the two groups. In addition, cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells were exposed to HBSS with different pH levels (7.3 or 6.5) or to culture medium (control). Apoptosis-related markers and beating function were analyzed. We found that the duration of survival was significantly longer in the study group (p<0.05). In addition, in pH 6.5 or pH 7.3 HBSS buffer, the expression levels of cell stress (p53) and apoptosis (caspase-3, Bcl-xL) markers were significantly lower in cardiomyocytes treated with 50 mM L-glutamine than those without L-glutamine (RT-PCR). L-glutamine also increased the beating function of cardiomyocytes, especially at the lower pH level (6.5). More importantly, glutamine decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and increased these cells' beating function at a low pH level. ? 2016 Yan-Ren Lin et al.",,"alanylglutamine; caspase 3; protective agent; protein bcl xl; protein p53; glutamine; acidosis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; cardiac muscle cell; cell function; cell stress; cell survival; cell transdifferentiation; clinical feature; controlled study; early intervention; heart protection; human; human cell; in vivo study; induced pluripotent stem cell; male; nonhuman; outcome assessment; pH; postcardiac arrest acidosis; prophylaxis; protein expression; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; rat; resuscitation; acidosis; animal; blood; cardiac muscle cell; cell culture; complication; disease model; heart arrest; metabolism; Wistar rat; Acidosis; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Disease Models, Animal; Glutamine; Heart Arrest; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Myocytes, Cardiac; Rats; Rats, Wistar",2-s2.0-85008884257

However, suitable biomarkers or potential therapeutic surrogates for Fabry cardiomyopathy (FC) in such patients under enzyme replacement treatment (ERT) remain unknown. Objective: Using FC patients carrying IVS4+919 G>A mutation, we constructed an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based disease model to investigate the pathogenetic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in ERT-treated FC. Results and methods: The iPSC-differentiated cardiomyocytes derived from FC-patients (FC-iPSC-CMs) carried IVS4+919 G>A mutation recapitulating FC characteristics, including low a-galactosidase A enzyme activity, cellular hypertrophy, and massive globotriaosylceramide accumulation. Microarray analysis revealed that interleukin-18 (IL-18), a pleiotropic cytokine involved in various myocardial diseases, was the most highly upregulated marker in FC-iPSC-CMs. Meanwhile, IL-18 levels were found to be significantly elevated in the culture media of FC-iPSC-CMs and patients' sera. Notably, the serum IL-18 levels were highly paralleled with the progression of left ventricular hypertrophy in Fabry patients receiving ERT. Finally, using FC-iPSC-CMs as in vitro FC model, neutralization of IL-18 with specific antibodies combined with ERT synergistically reduced the secretion of IL-18 and the progression of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in FC-iPSC-CMs. Conclusion: Our data demonstrated that cardiac IL-18 and circulating IL-18 are involved in the pathogenesis of FC and LVH. IL-18 may be a novel marker for evaluating ERT efficacy, and targeting IL-18 might be a potential adjunctive therapy combined with ERT for the treatment of advanced cardiomyopathy in FC patients with IVS4+919 G>A mutation.",Enzyme replacement therapy; Fabry cardiomyopathy; IL-18; IPSC,"agalsidase alfa; agalsidase beta; alpha galactosidase; globotriaosylceramide; interleukin 18; alpha galactosidase; alpha-galactosidase A, human; interleukin 18; interleukin 18 protein, human; adult; Article; cardiac muscle cell; cardiomyopathy; clinical article; controlled study; cytokine release; enzyme replacement; Fabry disease; female; gene mutation; GLA gene; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; human; human cell; in vitro study; induced pluripotent stem cell; male; antagonists and inhibitors; cytology; Fabry disease; genetics; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; metabolism; middle aged; mutation; physiology; alpha-Galactosidase; Enzyme Replacement Therapy; Fabry Disease; Female; Humans; Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Interleukin-18; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Myocytes, Cardiac",2-s2.0-85007485721

IA includes psychological and physiological syndromes, and among the syndromes, emotion was suggested important mental and physiological expressions of IA. However, few physiologically emotional characters of IA were investigated. Autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity was a good link between IA and emotion, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) gained from ANS was hypothesized related to IA. Methods: An emotional induction experiment using negative and positive emotional films was conducted to validate the hypotheses. Thirty-four participants recruited from college were classified into high-risk IA group (HIA) and low-risk IA group (LIA). The respiratory signals, ECG signals, and self-assessed emotional intensity were acquired. The relationship and difference between IA and RSA was tested using descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Results: The RSA values of HIA were lower than those of LIA both before and after the induction of positive and negative emotions. When participants experienced a negative emotion (anger or fear), their RSA values declined; the decline for HIA was greater than that for LIA. The RSA values of HIA participants before induction of fear, happiness, or surprise, statistically significantly differed from that after induction of those emotions, with p values of 0.007, 0.04 and 0.01 respectively. The difference between the changes in RSA values upon the induction of surprise of HIA and LIA was statistically significant difference (p = 0.03). The interaction between two IA groups among emotional induction states was statistically significant difference. Conclusions: RSA value here was the main variable that reflected ANS activity, and especially vagus nerve regulation. The results revealed that the changes in RSA values were biologically significantly different between HIA and LIA, especially when sadness, happiness, or surprise was induced. HIA people exhibited stronger RSA reactivity following negative emotion than LIA people, but the RSA reactivity following positive emotion was weaker. This study provides more physiological information about IA and assists further investigation on the regulation of the ANS for IA abusers. The results will benefit the further application, early detection, therapy, and even early prevention. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Autonomic nervous system; Emotion; Internet addiction; Linear model; Respiratory sinus arrhythmia; Vagus nerve regulation,"Behavioral research; Diseases; Autonomic nervous system; Emotion; Internet addiction; Linear modeling; Respiratory sinus arrhythmia; Vagus nerve; Physiology; adult; anger; Article; autonomic nervous system; controlled study; electrocardiogram; emotionality; fear; female; happiness; high risk population; human; human experiment; internet addiction; low risk population; male; movie; normal human; priority journal; respiratory sinus arrhythmia; vagus nerve stimulation; visual stimulation; addiction; analysis of variance; emotion; Internet; movie; pathophysiology; photostimulation; psychology; risk; statistical model; young adult; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Behavior, Addictive; Emotions; Female; Humans; Internet; Linear Models; Male; Motion Pictures as Topic; Photic Stimulation; Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia; Risk; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85007472483

Methods: A retrospective clinical study was conducted using data on 10 patients with elective EVAR, 7 patients with percutaneous EVAR, and 9 patients with consecutive rupture abdominal aortic aneurysm treated with emergency EVAR from January 2010 to December 2014. Results: The median length of intensive care unit stay for elective EVAR, percutaneous EVAR, and emergency EVAR cases: 1.80±0.92 days, 1.67±1.21 days, and 10.00±13.27 days, respectively; hospital days: 11.10±4.28 days, 11.00±4.10 days, and 21.89±18.35 days, respectively. Seven patients have no calcification in common femoral artery, and the use of a Perclose ProGlide device was under the guidance of sonography for percutaneous EVAR. The operative times of elective EVAR, percutaneous EVAR, and emergency EVAR were 192.3 ± 52.0 minutes, 169.2 ± 67.5 minutes, and 227.1 ± 59.9 minutes, and blood loss volumes were 150.0 ± 77.5 ml, 95.0 ± 78.6 ml, and 422.2 ± 276.3 ml, respectively. Technical success rate of Perclose ProGlide was 100%. Conclusions: Selective percutaneous access of the femoral arteries for EVAR is safe and effective in the studied cases. The complications can be avoided with careful selection of patients based on preoperative imaging.

Conventionally, Lissajous figure analysis is the most frequently used estimation of the phase difference in thoracoabdominal asynchrony. However, the temporal resolution of the produced results is low and the estimation error increases when the signals are not sinusoidal. Other previous studies have reported time-domain procedures with the use of band-pass filters for phase-angle estimation. Nevertheless, the band-pass filters need calibration for phase delay elimination. Methods: To improve the estimation, we propose a novel method (named as instantaneous phase difference) that is based on complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition for estimating the instantaneous phase relation between measured thoracic wall movement and abdominal wall movement. To validate the proposed method, experiments on simulated time series and human-subject respiratory data with two breathing types (i.e., thoracic breathing and abdominal breathing) were conducted. Latest version of Lissajous figure analysis and automatic phase estimation procedure were compared. Results: The simulation results show that the standard deviations of the proposed method were lower than those of two other conventional methods. The proposed method performed more accurately than the two conventional methods. For the human-subject respiratory data, the results of the proposed method are in line with those in the literature, and the correlation analysis result reveals that they were positively correlated with the results generated by the two conventional methods. Furthermore, the standard deviation of the proposed method was also the smallest. Conclusions: To summarize, this study proposes a novel method for estimating instantaneous phase differences. According to the findings from both the simulation and humansubject data, our approach was demonstrated to be effective. The method offers the following advantages: (1) improves the temporal resolution, (2) does not introduce a phase delay, (3) works with non-sinusoidal signals, (4) provides quantitative phase estimation without estimating the embedded frequency of breathing signals, and (5) works without calibrated measurements. The results demonstrate a higher temporal resolution of the phase difference estimation for the evaluation of thoracoabdominal asynchrony. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Instantaneous phase difference; Lissajous figure; Thoracoabdominal motion,"Bandpass filters; Biomedical signal processing; Estimation; Frequency estimation; Statistics; Complementary ensemble empirical mode decompositions; Conventional methods; Instantaneous phase; Lissajous figures; Nonsinusoidal signals; Phase angle estimations; Phase difference estimations; Thoracoabdominal motion; Time domain analysis; abdominal wall movement; analytic method; Article; autoregulation; biomedical engineering; breathing; breathing exercise; correlation analysis; energy; instantaneous phase difference method; mathematical analysis; medical parameters; plethysmography; priority journal; respiratory inductance plethysmography; signal processing; simulation; thoracic wall movement; thoracoabdominal asynchrony; abdominal wall; breathing; female; human; male; movement (physiology); physiology; signal processing; thorax wall; time factor; young adult; Abdominal Wall; Female; Humans; Male; Movement; Respiration; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Thoracic Wall; Time Factors; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84991694033

MYCN amplification is a potent driver of NB, which exerts its oncogenic activity through either activating or inhibiting the transcription of target genes. Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are reported to be altered in cancers including NB. However, lncRNAs that are altered by MYCN amplification and associated with outcome in high-risk NB patients are limitedly discovered. Herein, we examined the expression profiles of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes between MYCN amplified and MYCN non-amplified NB from microarray (n = 47) and RNAseq datasets (n = 493). We identified 6 lncRNAs in common that were differentially expressed (adjusted P ? 0.05 and fold change ? 2) and subsequently validated by RT-qPCR. The co-expression analysis reveals lncRNA, SNHG1 and coding gene, TAF1D highly co-expressed in NB. Kaplan-Meier analysis shows that higher expression of SNHG1 is significantly associated with poor patient survival. Importantly, multivariate analysis confirms high expression of SNHG1 as an independent prognostic marker for event-free survival (EFS) (HR = 1.58, P = 2.36E-02).

This pathogen is auxotrophic for cholesterol, which it converts upon uptake to various cholesteryl α-glucoside derivatives, including cholesteryl 6′-acyl and 6′-phosphatidyl α-glucosides (CAGs and CPGs). Owing to a lack of sensitive analytical methods, it is not known if CAGs and CPGs play distinct physiological roles or how the acyl chain component affects function. Herein we established a metabolite-labelling method for characterising these derivatives qualitatively and quantitatively with a femtomolar detection limit. The development generated an MS/MS database of CGds, allowing for profiling of all the cholesterol-derived metabolites. The subsequent analysis led to the unprecedented information that these bacteria acquire phospholipids from the membrane of epithelial cells for CAG biosynthesis. The resulting increase in longer or/and unsaturated CAG acyl chains helps to promote lipid raft formation and thus delivery of the virulence factor CagA into the host cell, supporting the idea that the host/pathogen interplay enhances bacterial virulence. These findings demonstrate an important connection between the chain length of CAGs and the bacterial pathogenicity. ? 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Biochemistry; Chains; Cholesterol; Metabolites; Phospholipids; Analytical method; Detection limits; Epithelial cells; Gastric disease; Helicobacter pylori; Human population; Physiological roles; Virulence factors; Carbohydrates,2-s2.0-84983523242

Here we show that aberrant expression of PRR in premalignant PanIN lesions, and human PDAC samples, and PDAC cell lines, particularly in Panc-1 cells. Interestingly, PRR expression was positively associated with PDAC progression. Moreover, overexpression of human PRR resulted in increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis, while knockdown of human PRR caused decreased cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. We also observed that overexpression of human PRR enhanced MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in PDAC cells, while knockdown of human PRR suppressed both of pathways. The confocal imaging analysis showed that human PRR was highly expressed in Panc-1, ASPC, and Miapaca cells, whereas BXPC-3, and HPAC cells had a significantly lower fluorescent signals. Consistently, the single-photon emission computed tomography (SPET/CT) showed that the uptake of anti-PRR labelled with 125I was higher in Panc- 1 and ASPC tumors-bearing mice after 96 hours injection. Importantly, tumors in pancreas of Pdx1-cre; LSL-KrasG12D mice had a significant increased PRR expression and accumulation of radioactivity at 96 h after injection.

However, the conventional oral examination with the visual inspection and the palpation of oral lesions is not an objective and reliable approach for oral cancer diagnosis, and it may cause the delayed hospital treatment for the patients of oral cancer or leads to the oral cancer out of control in the late stage. Therefore, a device for oral cancer detection are developed for early diagnosis and treatment. A portable LED Induced autofluorescence (LIAF) imager is developed by our group. It contained the multiple wavelength of LED excitation light and the rotary filter ring of eight channels to capture ex-vivo oral tissue autofluorescence images. The advantages of LIAF imager compared to other devices for oral cancer diagnosis are that LIAF imager has a probe of L shape for fixing the object distance, protecting the effect of ambient light, and observing the blind spot in the deep port between the gumsgingiva and the lining of the mouth. Besides, the multiple excitation of LED light source can induce multiple autofluorescence, and LIAF imager with the rotary filter ring of eight channels can detect the spectral images of multiple narrow bands. The prototype of a portable LIAF imager is applied in the clinical trials for some cases in Taiwan, and the images of the clinical trial with the specific excitation show the significant differences between normal tissue and oral tissue under these cases.

Pupillary abnormalities may be influenced on people by autonomic neuropathy, glaucoma, diabetes, genetic diseases, and high myopia. In the early stage of neuropathy, it is often asymptomatic and difficulty detectable by ophthalmologists. In addition, the position of injured nerve can lead to unsynchronized pupil response for human eyes. In our study, we design the pupilometer to measure the binocular pupil response simultaneously. It uses the different wavelength of LEDs such as white, red, green and blue light to stimulate the pupil and record the process. Therefore, the pupilometer mainly contains two systems. One is the image acquisition system, it use the two cameras modules with the same external triggered signal to capture the images of the pupil simultaneously. The other one is the illumination system. It use the boost converter ICs and LED driver ICs to supply the constant current for LED to maintain the consistent luminance in each experiments for reduced experimental error. Furthermore, the four infrared LEDs are arranged nearby the stimulating LEDs to illuminate eyes and increase contrast of image for image processing. In our design, we success to implement the function of synchronized image acquisition with the sample speed in 30 fps and the stable illumination system for precise measurement of experiment.

Nonetheless, few reports analyze the general outcome, complications, of single and combined therapy of 532/1064-nm Nd:YAG lasers in Asian patients with Fitzpatrick type IV skin. Study Design/Materials and Methods:We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive patients who completed 5 consecutive sessions at 1-month intervals of treatment with 1064-nm (spot size: 5-7 mm, 1.5-2.0 J/cm2) or combined with 532-nm (spot size, 2-3 mm; 0.5-1.5 J/cm2) Nd:YAG laser (Laseroptek, Korea) from October 2011 to March 2013. The patients, laser surgeon, and 3 blinded reviewers assessed the outcomes and complications. Improvement was graded as follows: 1, 0%-25%; 2, 26%-50%; 3, 51%-75%; 4, 76-90%; and 5, greater than 90%. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) was documented according to the severity (1, slight; 2, moderate; 3, severe; and 4, extreme).Other post-laser side effects were also documented (eg, scaling, dryness, erythema, and pruritus). Results: Four male patients and 37 female patients were included with a mean age of 38.5 years (SD, 10.1 years). There were no significant differences on patients', surgeon's, or blinded reviewers' improvement gradings. (4.11 ± 0.62 vs 4.30 ± 0.46, P=0.54; 3.88 ± 0.66 vs 3.89 ± 0.31, P=0.50; 3.30 ± 0.69 vs 3.74 ± 0.38, P=0.34). Transient minor side effect occurred as follows: erythema in 9 (22%), pruritus in 7 (17%), dryness in 6 (15%), and scaling in 6 (15%). There was no risk difference in these side effects between groups. The PIH scores were slight in 10 patients (4 in single and 6 in combined), severe in 4 (3 in single and 1 in combined), and extreme in 1 (single therapy). The PIH incidence also did not differ (33.3%, 35.3%; P=0.58). Conclusions: We reported satisfactory outcomes after low-fluence Q-switched sole 1064-nmor combined 532/1064-nmtherapy. The outcome and complication profiles did not differ between the groups. The PIH incidence was not low, but usually transient. The incidence of severe or extreme PIH was rare.

This study describes an update of the miRTar-Base (http://miRTarBase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/) that provides information about experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions (MTIs). The latest update of the miRTarBase expanded it to identify systematically Argonaute-miRNA-RNA interactions from 138 crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-seq) data sets that were generated by 21 independent studies. The database contains 4966 articles, 7439 strongly validated MTIs (using reporter assays or western blots) and 348 007 MTIs from CLIP-seq. The number of MTIs in the miRTarBase has increased around 7-fold since the 2014 miRTar-Base update. The miRNA and gene expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) are integrated to provide an effective overview of this exponential growth in the miRNA experimental data. These improvements make the miRTarBase one of the more comprehensively annotated, experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions databases and motivate additional miRNA research efforts. ? 2015 The Author(s).",,"argonaute protein; microRNA; messenger RNA; microRNA; Article; controlled study; cross linking; gene expression; immunoprecipitation; natural language processing; nucleic acid database; priority journal; protein RNA binding; chemistry; diseases; gene expression profiling; genetics; human; metabolism; sequence analysis; Databases, Nucleic Acid; Disease; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; MicroRNAs; RNA, Messenger; Sequence Analysis, RNA",2-s2.0-84976904131

More specifically, leakage power plays a dominant role in system power dissipation. An emerging circuit design style, the reconfigurable single-electron transistor (SET) array, has been proposed for continuing Moore's Law due to its ultra-low leakage power consumption. Recently, several works have been proposed to address the issues related to automated synthesis for the reconfigurable SET array. Nevertheless, all of those existing approaches consider mandatory fabrication constraints of SET array merely in late synthesis stages. In this article, we propose a synthesis algorithm, featuring input-variable ordering and dynamic product term ordering, for area minimization. The fabrication constraints are taken into account at every synthesis stage of proposed flow to guarantee better synthesis outcomes. We also develop a simulated annealing-based postprocess to find a proper phase assignment of each input variable for further area reduction. Experimental results show that our new methodology can achieve up to 29% area reduction as compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. ? 2016 ACM.",Algorithms; Area minimization; Automatic synthesis; Automatic synthesis; B.6.3 [logic design]: design aids; Reconfigurable structure; Single-electron transistor,Algorithms; Capacitance measurement; Electric losses; Fabrication; Reconfigurable hardware; Simulated annealing; Area minimization; Automated synthesis; Automatic synthesis; Fabrication constraints; Fabrication process; Reconfigurable structure; State-of-the-art techniques; Synthesis algorithms; Single electron transistors,2-s2.0-84973917815

Utilizing the self-regulatory resource theory, we argue that insomnia decreases workers' safety behaviors, resulting in increased workplace injuries. Moreover, in order to ultimately derive organizational interventions to alleviate the detrimental impact of insomnia on workplace injuries, we propose that supervisor safety priority can create situational strength that can prevent workers from behaving unsafely despite experiencing insomnia. Our theoretical model was examined and empirically supported using hierarchically nested data collected from supervisors (N = 482) and workers (N = 2,737) in a midsized construction services company. Results were consistent with the proposed conceptual framework; the relationship between insomnia and injuries is explained by the influence of insomnia on safety behaviors. For workers supervised by supervisors with high safety priority, both the relationship between insomnia and safety behaviors and the indirect relationship between insomnia and workplace injuries were weaker. We provide theoretical implications for future safety research and suggest tentative directions for practitioners working to reduce workplace injuries through sleep-oriented interventions. ? 2015 American Psychological Association.",Injuries; Insomnia; Occupational safety; Safety behavior; Safety priority,"adult; Article; conceptual framework; construction worker; controlled study; disease association; employee attitude; female; human; insomnia; major clinical study; male; occupational accident; occupational safety; priority journal; theoretical model; workplace; complication; insomnia; middle aged; occupational health; Occupational Injuries; questionnaire; safety; United States; workplace; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Occupational Health; Occupational Injuries; Safety Management; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States; Workplace",2-s2.0-84954195340

Method: Data for 27 547 patients with newly diagnosed depressive disorders and 27 547 subjects without depressive disorders between 2001 and 2008 were yielded from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss incidence at the end of 2011 was determined. Cumulative incidence and adjusted hazard ratio were computed. Results: Sudden sensorineural hearing loss incidence was 1.45 times higher in the depressive disorders group compared to the non-depressive disorders group (p = 0.0041), with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.460. A significant increased risk of developing sudden sensorineural hearing loss was noted in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease and hyperlipidaemia (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The results suggest an increased risk of developing sudden sensorineural hearing loss in patients with depressive disorders. Co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease and hyperlipidaemia significantly aggravated the risk. Depressive disorders might be considered a risk factor for sudden sensorineural hearing loss. It remains to be seen whether control of depressive disorders can decrease the incidence of sudden sensorineural hearing loss in patients with depressive disorders. ?

This multi-functional nanoparticle system has a pH-sensitive CaP shell and degradable amphiphilic gelatin (AG) core, which enables controllable sequential release of the two drugs. The dual-targeting system of AGIO@CaP-CD (HER-AGIO@CaP-CD) with a bioligand and magnetic targeting resulted in significantly elevated cellular uptake in HER2-overexpressing SKBr3 cells and more efficacious therapy than delivery of targeting ligand alone due to the synergistic cell multi-drug resistance/apoptosis-inducing effect of the CUR and DOX combination.

Existing studies for developing HCV vaccines have mainly focused on T-cell immune response. However, identification of linear B-cell epitopes that can stimulate B-cell response is one of the major tasks of peptide-based vaccine development. Owing to the variability in B-cell epitope length, the prediction of B-cell epitopes is much more complex than that of T-cell epitopes. Furthermore, the motifs of linear B-cell epitopes in different pathogens are quite different (e. g. HCV and hepatitis B virus). To cope with this challenge, this work aims to propose an HCV-customized sequence-based prediction method to identify B-cell epitopes of HCV. Results: This work establishes an experimentally verified dataset comprising the B-cell response of HCV dataset consisting of 774 linear B-cell epitopes and 774 non B-cell epitopes from the Immune Epitope Database. An interpretable rule mining system of B-cell epitopes (IRMS-BE) is proposed to select informative physicochemical properties (PCPs) and then extracts several if-then rule-based knowledge for identifying B-cell epitopes. A web server Bcell-HCV was implemented using an SVM with the 34 informative PCPs, which achieved a training accuracy of 79.7% and test accuracy of 70.7% better than the SVM-based methods for identifying B-cell epitopes of HCV and the two general-purpose methods. This work performs advanced analysis of the 34 informative properties, and the results indicate that the most effective property is the alpha-helix structure of epitopes, which influences the connection between host cells and the E2 proteins of HCV. Furthermore, 12 interpretable rules are acquired from top-five PCPs and achieve a sensitivity of 75.6% and specificity of 71.3%. Finally, a conserved promising vaccine candidate, PDREMVLYQE, is identified for inclusion in a vaccine against HCV. Conclusions: This work proposes an interpretable rule mining system IRMS-BE for extracting interpretable rules using informative physicochemical properties and a web server Bcell-HCV for predicting linear B-cell epitopes of HCV. IRMS-BE may also apply to predict B-cell epitopes for other viruses, which benefits the improvement of vaccines development of these viruses without significant modification.

The present study was aimed at determining the effects of Se supplementation, as Se yeast, on oxidative stress in non-tumor/tumor tissues, as well as regulation of the apoptotic process, and immune responses in mice-bearing breast tumor xenografts. Female BALB/cByJNarl mice were divided into control (CNL and CNL-con), Se-supplemented control (CNL-HS, given as a single oral dose of 912 ng Se daily), breast tumor-bearing (TB and TB-con), TB-LS (228 ng Se), TB-MS (456 ng Se) and TB-HS (912 ng Se) groups. All mice were treated with/without Se for 14 days. A number of variables were further measured. Compared with the TB groups, tumor bearing mice with Se supplement had increased plasma Se concentrations, reduced erythrocyte Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) products and inhibited tumor growth. They have also higher Se concentrations in non-tumor and tumor tissues. Significantly elevated concentrations of MDA and reduced GPx activities, as well as increased anti-apoptotic bcl-2 and tumor suppressor p53 concentrations in tumor tissues were observed as Se accumulated in tumor, whereas lower MDA products were found in various non-tumor tissues than did the corresponding values. Further, there were elevated concentrations of Th1-derived cytokines and decreased Th2-type interleukin (IL)-4 in tumor-bearing mice with the treatment of Se. In conclusion, accumulation of Se in tumors may induce oxidative stress and p53-dependent pro-oxidative apoptosis, thus inhibiting the growth of breast tumor. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc..",Apoptosis; Breast cancer; Mice; Oxidative stress; Selenium yeast,"gamma interferon; glutathione peroxidase; interleukin 2; interleukin 4; malonaldehyde; protein bcl 2; protein p53; selenium; antineoplastic agent; antioxidant; cytokine; glutathione peroxidase; malonaldehyde; oxidizing agent; oxygen; protein p53; reactive oxygen metabolite; selenium; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; antioxidant activity; apoptosis; Article; body weight; breast tumor; cancer inhibition; controlled study; cytokine production; dose response; drug mechanism; enzyme activity; female; food intake; lipid peroxidation; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene; oxidation; oxidative stress; selenium yeast; single drug dose; supplementation; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; tumor xenograft; yeast; animal; Bagg albino mouse; Breast Neoplasms; chemistry; cytology; dietary supplement; drug screening; inflammation; metabolism; pathology; tumor cell line; yeast; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Antioxidants; Apoptosis; Body Weight; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cytokines; Dietary Supplements; Female; Glutathione Peroxidase; Inflammation; Malondialdehyde; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Oxidants; Oxidative Stress; Oxygen; Reactive Oxygen Species; Selenium; Th1 Cells; Th2 Cells; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays; Yeasts",2-s2.0-84983203490

However, few studies are available that report whether neuronal firing can be accurately recorded during this condition. In this study the authors attempted to characterize the neuronal activity of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and elucidate the influence of general anesthetics on neurons during DBS surgery in patients with PD. The benefit of median nerve stimulation (MNS) for localization of the dorsolateral subterritory of the STN, which is involved in sensorimotor function, was explored. Methods Eight patients with PD were anesthetized with desflurane and underwent contralateral MNS at the wrist during microelectrode recording of the STN. The authors analyzed the spiking patterns and power spectral density (PSD) of the background activity along each penetration track and determined the spatial correlation to the target location, estimated using standard neurophysiological procedures. Results The dorsolateral STN spiking pattern showed a more prominent bursting pattern without MNS and more oscillation with MNS. In terms of the neural oscillation of the background activity, beta-band oscillation dominated within the sensorimotor STN and showed significantly more PSD during MNS (p < 0.05). Conclusions Neuronal firing within the STN could be accurately identified and differentiated when patients with PD received general anesthetics. Median nerve stimulation can enhance the neural activity in beta-band oscillations, which can be used as an index to ensure optimal electrode placement via successfully tracked dorsolateral STN topography. ?

Design of study Case-crossover design. Methods and Materials Elderly enrollees (n = 6010) in Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database with zolpidem or benzodiazepine use were analyzed for the risk of developing fractures. Results After adjusting for medications such as antipsychotics, antidepressants, and diuretics, or comorbidities such as hypertension, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis and depression, neither zolpidem nor benzodiazepine was found to be associated with increased risk in all-sites fractures. Subjects without depression were found to have an increased risk of fractures. Diazepam is the only benzodiazepine with increased risk of fractures after adjusting for medications and comorbidities. Hip and spine were particular sites for increased fracture risk, but following adjustment for comorbidities, the associations were found to be insignificant. Conclusion Neither zolpidem nor benzodiazepine was associated with increased risk of all-site fractures in this case cross-over study after adjusting for medications or comorbidities in elderly individuals with insomnia.

However, no large-scale clinical studies have evaluated whether TCM is associated with better survival in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC).Methods: The Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database was used to conduct a retrospective cohort study of patients with HNC between 2001 and 2011. The patients with HNC were separated into TCM users and non-users, and Cox regression models were applied to determine the association between the use of TCM and survival outcome. Results: The TCM and comparison cohorts comprised data for 2966 and 2670 patients, respectively. The mean age was 51.3 years in the TCM cohort and 51.7 years in the comparison cohort. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the use of TCM was significantly associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality by 32% (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-0.75). Patients with longer TCM use had a lower mortality rate (P for trend < 0.001).Conclusions: Our study showed that adjunctive therapy with TCM is associated with higher survival outcome. However, some limitations exist, such as the lack of information of cancer stage. In addition, causality cannot be assessed with this retrospective study.

This heterogeneity often leads to difficulties in interpreting results and conclusions due to unrevealed relationships. Understanding the underlying relationship between injury severities and influential factors is critical for the selection of appropriate safety countermeasures. A method commonly employed to address systematic heterogeneity is to focus on any subgroup of data based on the research purpose. However, this need not ensure homogeneity in the data. In this paper, latent class cluster analysis is applied to identify homogenous subgroups for a specific crash type-pedestrian crashes. The manuscript employs data from police reported pedestrian (2009-2012) crashes in Switzerland. The analyses demonstrate that dividing pedestrian severity data into seven clusters helps in reducing the systematic heterogeneity of the data and to understand the hidden relationships between crash severity levels and socio-demographic, environmental, vehicle, temporal, traffic factors, and main reason for the crash. The pedestrian crash injury severity models were developed for the whole data and individual clusters, and were compared using receiver operating characteristics curve, for which results favored clustering. Overall, the study suggests that latent class clustered regression approach is suitable for reducing heterogeneity and revealing important hidden relationships in traffic safety analyses.",Binary logit; Cluster analysis; Latent class; Pedestrian; Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; Severity; Switzerland,"Accident prevention; Adaptive systems; Cluster analysis; Computerized tomography; Crashworthiness; Factor analysis; Highway accidents; Learning algorithms; Pedestrian safety; Safety engineering; Binary logit; Latent class; Pedestrian; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Severity; Switzerland; Accidents; adolescent; adult; aged; child; cluster analysis; female; human; infant; injuries; male; middle aged; pedestrian; police; preschool child; safety; statistics and numerical data; Switzerland; traffic accident; very elderly; walking; young adult; Accidents, Traffic; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Pedestrians; Police; Safety; Switzerland; Walking; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84944062678

An efficient room-temperature phosphorescence NQO1 probe was constructed by using Mn-doped ZnS quantum dots (Mn:ZnS QDs) as donors and trimethylquinone propionic acids as acceptors. Phosphorescence quenching of Mn:ZnS QDs from the Mn:ZnS QDs to a covalently bonded quinone was achieved through PET. Phosphorescence of Mn:ZnS QDs was turned on by the rapid reduction-initiated removal of the quinone quencher by NQO1.

Early diagnosis and management remain the cornerstone for good clinical outcomes, thus efficient and accurate diagnostic technology in the early stage of the disease is urgently needed. Serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the DENV1 nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), DA12-4, DA13-2, and DA15-3, which were recently generated using the hybridoma technique, are suitable for use in diagnostic platforms. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot analysis further confirmed the serotype specificity of these three monoclonal antibodies. The ELISA-based diagnostic platform was established using the combination of two highly sensitive mAbs (DA15-3 and DB20-6). The same combination was also used for the flow cytometry-based diagnostic platform. We report here the detection limits of flow cytometry-based and ELISA-based diagnostic platforms using these mAbs to be 0.1 and 1 ng/mL, respectively. The collected clinical patient serum samples were also assayed by these two serotyping diagnostic platforms. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting NS1 protein of DENV1 are 90% and 96%, respectively. The accuracy of our platform for testing clinical samples is more advanced than that of the two commercial NS1 diagnostic platforms.

Ultrafast pMMUS can localize the SPIOs drained to the SLNs and thus identify the SLNs. Experiments on rats were carried out to verify the feasibility. The SLN was identified in pMMUS images which was confirmed by the methylene blue assay while it is challenging to be localized in B-mode image. Overall, we demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed ultrafast pMMUS for noninvasive SLN identification.

Developing a countermeasure to track drivers' focus of attention (FOA) and engagement of operators in dual (multi)-tasking conditions is thus imperative. Ten healthy volunteers participated in a dual-task experiment that comprised two tasks: a lane-keeping driving task and a mathematical problem-solving task (e.g., 24+15=37?) during which their electroencephalogram (EEG) and behaviors were concurrently recorded. Independent component analysis (ICA) was employed as a spatial filter to separate the contributions of independent sources from the recorded EEG data. The power spectra of six components (i.e., frontal, central, parietal, occipital, left motor, and right motor) extracted from single-task conditions were fed into support vector machine (SVM) based on the radial basis function (RBF) kernel to build an FOA assessment system. The system achieved 84.6±5.8% and 86.2±5.4% classification accuracies in detecting the participants' FOAs on the math versus driving tasks, respectively. This FOA assessment system was then applied to evaluate participants' FOAs during dual-task conditions. The detected FOAs revealed that participants' cognitive attention and strategies dynamically changed between tasks to optimize the overall performance, as attention was limited and competed. The empirical results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of a practical system to continuously estimating cognitive attention through EEG spectra. ? 2001-2011 IEEE.",Electrodes; Electroencephalography; Equations; Mathematical model; Problem-solving; Training; Vehicles,Electrodes; Electrophysiology; Independent component analysis; Machine components; Mathematical models; Personnel training; Problem solving; Radial basis function networks; Support vector machines; Vehicles; Catastrophic consequences; Classification accuracy; Dual-task conditions; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Equations; Independent component analyses (ICA); Mathematical problem solving; Radial Basis Function(RBF); Electroencephalography; adult; attention; brain; car driving; cognition; electroencephalography; human; male; normal human; physiology; problem solving; procedures; psychology; psychomotor performance; reaction time; statistics and numerical data; support vector machine; vision; young adult; Adult; Attention; Automobile Driving; Brain; Cognition; Electroencephalography; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Problem Solving; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Support Vector Machine; Visual Perception; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84947065769

However, the clinical use of many photosensitizers is impeded by their hydrophobicity, the nonspecific damage they cause to normal tissues, and their susceptibility to environmental degradation. In this study, we developed a simple electrostatic adsorption strategy to fabricate aptamer-silica nanocomposites by sequentially functionalizing nanocomposites with the cell surface-associated mucin 1 aptamer for tumor targeting and a hydrophilic photosensitizer, methylene blue, for photodynamic therapy applications. We investigated the relationship between the biophysical properties and cellular uptake of such nanocomposites to improve their formulation. Effective generation of singlet oxygen was achieved with a low photosensitizer dosage (0.5μM) and a short, low-power irradiation (1min, 10mW/cm2). With the current strategy, the efficiency of photodynamic therapy was determined by the cellular uptake of nanocomposites and the targeting molecules used. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Aptamer-silica nanocomposite; Electrostatic assembly; Methylene blue; Photodynamic therapy; Singlet oxygen,"Aromatic compounds; Cell membranes; Electrostatics; Nanocomposites; Oxygen; Photosensitizers; Silica; Biophysical properties; Electrostatic adsorption; Electrostatic assembly; Methylene Blue; Noninvasive technique; Reactive oxygen species; Silica nanocomposites; Singlet oxygen; Photodynamic therapy; aptamer; methylene blue; mucin 1; mucin1 silica nanocomposite; photosensitizing agent; silica nanoparticle; singlet oxygen; unclassified drug; methylene blue; mucin 1; nanocomposite; photosensitizing agent; silicon dioxide; adsorption kinetics; Article; cancer cell line; cell surface; cell transport; cell viability; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug synthesis; drug targeting; drug uptake; human; human cell; hydrophilicity; in vitro study; nanofabrication; nanopharmaceutics; photodynamic therapy; photodynamics; photosensitization; priority journal; radiation dose; static electricity; adsorption; cell survival; chemical phenomena; chemistry; drug effects; Neoplasms; photochemotherapy; procedures; static electricity; tumor cell line; Adsorption; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Drug Delivery Systems; Humans; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Methylene Blue; Mucin-1; Nanocomposites; Neoplasms; Photochemotherapy; Photosensitizing Agents; Silicon Dioxide; Singlet Oxygen; Static Electricity",2-s2.0-84938786870

Herein, a self-monitored and self-delivered photosensitizer-doped FRET nanoparticle (NP) drug delivery system (DDS) is designed for this purpose. During preparation, a donor/acceptor pair of perylene and 5,10,15,20-tetro (4-pyridyl) porphyrin (H2TPyP) is co-doped into a chemotherapeutic anticancer drug curcumin (Cur) matrix. In the system, Cur works as a chemotherapeutic agent. In the meantime, the green fluorescence of Cur molecules is quenched (OFF) in the form of NPs and can be subsequently recovered (ON) upon release in tumor cells, which enables additional imaging and real-time self-monitoring capabilities. H2TPyP is employed as a photodynamic therapeutic drug, but it also emits efficient NIR fluorescence for diagnosis via FRET from perylene. By exploiting the emission characteristics of these two emitters, the combinatorial drugs provide a real-time dual-fluorescent imaging/tracking system in vitro and in vivo, and this has not been reported before in self-delivered DDS which simultaneously shows a high drug loading capacity (77.6%Cur). Overall, our carrier-free DDS is able to achieve chemotherapy (Cur), photodynamic therapy (H2TPyP), and real-time self-monitoring of the release and distribution of the nanomedicine (Cur and H2TPyP).

E. coli O157:H7 can cause bloody diarrhea, hemolytic uremic syndrome, or even death. The pathogenicity of E. coli O157:H7 is mainly caused by the expression of Shiga-like toxins (SLTs), i.e., SLT-1 and SLT-2. SLTs are pentamers composed of a single A and five B subunits. In this study, we propose a magnetic nanoparticle (MNP)-based platform to rapidly identify SLT-1 from the complex cell lysate of E. coli O157:H7. The core of the MNPs is made of iron oxide, whereas the surface of the core is coated with a thin layer of alumina (Fe3O4@Al2O3 MNPs). The Fe3O4@Al2O3 MNPs are functionalized with pigeon ovalbumin (POA), which contains Gal-α(1→4)-Gal-β(1→4)-GlcNAc termini that can bind SLT-1B selectively. Furthermore, POA is a phosphate protein. Thus, it can be easily immobilized on the surface of the Fe3O4@Al2O3 MNPs through aluminum phosphate chelation under microwave heating within 1.5 min. The generated POA-Fe3O4@Al2O3 MNPs are capable of effectively enriching SLT-1B from complex cell lysates simply by pipetting 20 μL of the sample in and out of the tip in a vial for ?1 min. To release SLT-1 from the MNPs, Gal-α(1→4)-Gal disaccharides were used for displacement. The released target species are sufficient to be identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Although the sample volume used in this approach is small (20 μL) and the enrichment time is short (1 min), the selectivity of this approach toward SLT-1B is quite good. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach for rapid determination of the presence of SLT-1 from complex cell lysates and ham/juice samples based on the detection of SLT-1B. ? 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Alumina; Aluminum; Aluminum coatings; Desorption; Escherichia coli; Food safety; Mass spectrometry; Microwave heating; Nanomagnetics; Nanoparticles; Aluminum phosphates; Complex samples; Escherichia coli O157:H7; Food-borne illness; Magnetic nanoparticles; Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry; Shiga-like toxins; Target species; Iron compounds; magnetite nanoparticle; verotoxin 1; analysis; chemistry; cytology; Escherichia coli O157; food contamination; mass spectrometry; Escherichia coli O157; Food Contamination; Magnetite Nanoparticles; Shiga Toxin 1; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization",2-s2.0-84945270775

Apart from its carcinogenic activity, arsenic also shows promoting effects on angiogenesis, a crucial process for tumor growth. Yet, the mechanism underlying arsenic-induced angiogenesis is not fully understood. In this study, we aimed at investigating the involvement of inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (Id1) and the associated signal molecules in the arsenic-mediated angiogenesis. Our initial screening revealed that treatment with low concentrations of arsenic (0.5-1 μM) led to multiple cellular responses, including enhanced endothelial cell viability and angiogenic activity as well as increased protein expression of Id1. The arsenic-induced angiogenesis was suppressed in the Id1-knocked down cells compared to that in control cells. Furthermore, arsenic-induced Id1 expression and angiogenic activity were regulated by PI3K/Akt, NF-κB, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) signaling.

The most common analgesics are nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs and Acetaminophen, both of which relieve pain and reduce body temperature. In clinical experiences, they exhibit effective pain control; however, their influence on body temperature remains controversial. This study is aimed at determining the effects of analgesics at the acute stage of traumatic fracture by performing a clinical retrospective study of patients with fractures and a fracture animal model. The retrospective study revealed that, in the acetaminophen group, the mean value of postmedication body temperature (BT) was significantly higher than that of the premedication BT. The change in BT was highly related with the medication rather than other risk factors. Forty eight 12-week-old male Wistar rats were divided into 6 groups: a control group, fracture group, fracture-Acetaminophen group, Acetaminophen group, fracture- Arcoxia group, and Arcoxia group. Fracture rats were prepared by breaking their unilateral tibia and fibula. Their inflammation conditions were evaluated by measuring their serum cytokine level and their physiological status was evaluated by estimating their central temperature, heart rate, and mean blood pressure. The hepatic adverse effects were assessed by measuring the serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (sGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (sGPT). The central temperature in the fracture-Acetaminophen group exceeded that in the groups fed normal saline water or Arcoxia. Accumulated hepatic injury was presented as steadily ascending curves of sGOT and sGPT. Inflammation-related cytokine levels were not higher in the Acetaminophen fracture group and were significantly lower in the fracture-Arcoxia group. Fever appeared to be aggravated by acetaminophen and more related to the elevation of hepatic enzymes than to the change in the inflammation- related cytokines. We suggest that acetaminophen may aggravate fever at the acute stage of fracture. This response is highly related to the accumulated and exacerbated side effects of hepatitis that are caused by the medication and trauma. ? 2015 Yeh et al.

When 5-Fluorouracil, a major chemoagent, is combined with hydroxyapatite nanocarriers by interclay insertion, the modified hydroxyapatite nanoparticles have superior lysosomal degradation profiles, which could be leveraged as controlled drug release. The decomposition of the hydroxyapatite nanocarriers facilitates the release of 5-Fluorouracil into the cytoplasm causing cell death. Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles with/without 5-Fluorouracil were synthesized and analyzed in this study. Their crystallization properties and chemical composition were examined by X-ray diffraction and Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy. The 5-Fluorouracil release rate was determined by UV spectroscopy. The biocompatibility of hydroxyapatite-5-Fluorouracil extraction solution was assessed using 3T3 cells via a WST-8 assay. The effect of hydroxyapatite-5-Fluorouracil particles which directly work on the human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells was evaluated by a lactate dehydrogenase assay via contact cultivation. A 5-Fluorouracil-absorbed hydroxyapatite particles were also tested. Overall, hydroxyapatite-5-Fluorouracils were prepared using a co-precipitation method wherein 5-Fluorouracil was intercalated in the hydroxyapatite lattice as determined by X-ray diffraction. Energy dispersive scanning examination showed the 5-Fluorouracil content was higher in hydroxyapatite-5-Fluorouracil than in a prepared absorption formulation. With 5-Fluorouracil insertion in the lattice, the widths of the a and c axial constants of the hydroxyapatite crystal increased. The extraction solution of hydroxyapatite-5-Fluorouracil was nontoxic to 3T3 cells, in which 5-Fluorouracil was not released in a neutral phosphate buffer solution. In contrast, at a lower pH value (2.5), 5-Fluorouracil was released by the acidic decomposition of hydroxyapatite. Finally, the results of the lactate dehydrogenase assay revealed that 5-Fluorouracil-hydroxyapatite was highly toxic to A549 cells through direct culture, this phenomenon may result from lysosomal decomposition of particles causing 5-Fluorouracil releasing. The pH-responsive hydroxyapatite-5-Fluorouracil nanoparticles have the potential to be part of a selective drug-delivery system in chemotherapy for cancer treatment. ?

We assessed whether the serial QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) assay and serial tuberculin skin test (TST) were reliable tools to predict or exclude the development of active tuberculosis (TB). Methods: This prospective observational cohort study involved non-bacillus Calmette-Gu?rin-vaccinated 259 elderly nursing home residents free of active TB at baseline. Of these, 147 were eligible for follow up. Participants underwent serial QFT-G and TST at baseline and 2-year follow up, and were monitored for active TB over 5years. Agreement between QFT-G and TST, incidence rate ratio, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for progression to active TB were measured. Results: During 5-year follow up, three participants developed active TB. The agreement between these two tests was 54.13% (K{green}=0.167, P=0.001). The incidence rate ratio was 15.8 (P=0.016) for the QFT-G-conversion group compared with the TST-positive group at baseline. Positive predictive value for QFT-G conversion groups was 25%. Negative predictive value was 100% for the TST-negative group at baseline. Conclusion: In the elderly nursing home residents, QFT-G conversion is a more reliable tool to predict the development of active TB. Meanwhile, TST is a valuable tool for predicting the chance of not developing active TB. ? 2015 Japan Geriatrics Society.",Elderly; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Nursing home residents; Quantiferon TB-Gold assay; Tuberculin skin test,"BCG vaccine; adult; aged; aging; Article; cohort analysis; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; follow up; human; incidence; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; nursing home patient; observational study; prediction; predictive value; priority journal; prospective study; Quantiferon TB Gold assay; reliability; serodiagnosis; Taiwan; tuberculin test; tuberculosis; vaccination; female; nursing home; reproducibility; tuberculosis; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Nursing Homes; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Taiwan; Tuberculin Test; Tuberculosis",2-s2.0-84942821967

As quite a number of guidance schemes have been proposed, the studies on maneuver are comparatively few. This paper thus proposes a maneuvering system for the passive type of robot walking helper based on user intention. The proposed system first recognizes motion intention from user-applied force and hip rotation, and then utilizes an assistive control strategy to generate proper braking torque for effective maneuver.

The aim of this study was to survey the epidemiology and molecular characteristics of fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible S. pyogenes in Taiwan. A total of 350 consecutive S. pyogenes isolates were collected between January 2005 and December 2012, including 152 (43.4%) invasive and 198 (56.6%) noninvasive isolates. Thirty-nine isolates (11.1%) of S. pyogenes were nonsusceptible to fluoroquinolones, including one emm1/ST28, 4 emm4/ST39, 33 emm12/ST36, and 1 emm87/ST62. Of all the isolates, emm12 (50%) demonstrated the highest prevalence of fluoroquinolone nonsusceptibility. Alterations of Ser79Phe and Ala12Val in ParC were the most frequently mutations in fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible S. pyogenes isolates. There were no amino acid substitutions in GyrB, and 1 emm87 isolate exhibited 3 nonsynonymous mutations in ParE.

Normally, migraine symptoms can be categorized into four different stages: inter-ictal, pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal stages. Since migraine patients are difficulty knowing when they will suffer migraine attacks, therefore, early detection becomes an important issue, especially for low-frequency migraine patients who have less than 5 times attacks per month. The main goal of this study is to develop a migraine-stage classification system based on migraineurs' resting-state EEG power. We collect migraineurs' O1 and O2 EEG activities during closing eyes from occipital lobe to identify pre-ictal and non-pre-ictal stages. Self-Constructing Neural Fuzzy Inference Network (SONFIN) is adopted as the classifier in the migraine stages classification which can reach the better classification accuracy (66%) in comparison with other classifiers.

Recent years, many research had investigated that using EEG signals can effectively detect driver's drowsiness level. However, real-time monitoring system is required to apply these fatigue level detection techniques in the practical application, especially in the real-road driving. Therefore, it required less channels, portable and wireless, real-time monitoring and processing techniques for developing the real-time monitoring system. In this study, we develop a single channel wireless EEG device which can real-time detect driver's fatigue level on the mobile device such as smart phone or tablet. The developed device is investigated to obtain a better and precise understanding of brain activities of mental fatigue under driving, which is of great benefit for devolvement of detection of driving fatigue system. This system consists of a Bluetooth-enabled one channel EEG, a regression model, and smartphone, which was a platform recording and transforming the raw EEG data to useful driving status. In the experiment, this was a sustained-attention driving task to implement in a virtual-reality (VR) driving simulator. To training model and develop the system, we were performed for 15 subjects to study Electroencephalography (EEG) brain dynamics by using a mobile and wireless EEG device. Based on the outstanding training results, the leave-one-subject-out cross validation test obtained 90% fatigue detection accuracy.

However, BP has an unstable structure that reduces its antitumor activity and half-life in vivo. Objective: The aim of this study is to design a drug delivery system to encapsulate BP to enhance its efficacy by improving its protection and delivery. Methods: To protect its structural stability against protein-rich and peroxide solutions, BP was encapsulated into a lipo-PEG-PEI complex (LPPC). Then, the cytotoxicity of BP/LPPC following preincubation in protein-rich, acid/alkaline, and peroxide solutions was analyzed by MTT. Cell uptake of BP/LPPC was also measured by confocal microscopy. The therapeutic effects of BP/LPPC were analyzed in xenograft mice following intratumoral and intravenous injections. Results: When BP was encapsulated in LPPC, its cytotoxicity was maintained following preincubation in protein-rich, acid/alkaline, and peroxide solutions. The cytotoxic activity of encapsulated BP was higher than that of free BP (~4.5-to 8.5-fold). This increased cytotoxic activity of BP/LPPC is attributable to its rapid transport across the cell membrane. In an animal study, a subcutaneously xenografted glioblastoma multiforme mouse that was treated with BP by intratumoral and intravenous administration showed inhibited tumor growth. The same dose of BP/LPPC was significantly more effective in terms of tumor inhibition. Conclusion: LPPC encapsulation technology is able to protect BP’s structural stability and enhance its antitumor effects, thus providing a better tool for use in cancer therapy. ? 2015 Lin et al.",Antitumor; Glioblastoma multiforme; Lipo-PEG-PEI complex; n-butylidenephthalide,"antineoplastic agent; drug carrier; n butylidenephthalide; plant medicinal product; polyethylene glycol polyethylenimine liposome complex; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; butylidenephthalide; liposome; macrogol derivative; phthalic anhydride; poly(ethylene glycol)-co-poly(ethyleneimine); polyethyleneimine; protective agent; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer inhibition; cell viability; confocal microscopy; controlled study; dose response; drug cytotoxicity; drug dosage form comparison; drug efficacy; drug oxidation; drug release; drug stability; drug structure; drug transport; encapsulation; female; glioblastoma; human; human cell; IC50; in vitro study; internalization; liposomal delivery; mouse; MTT assay; nonhuman; rat; tumor xenograft; zeta potential; analogs and derivatives; animal; blood brain barrier; Brain Neoplasms; chemistry; drug delivery system; drug effects; drug screening; glioblastoma; immunohistochemistry; intravenous drug administration; male; nude mouse; spectrofluorometry; tumor cell line; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Drug Delivery Systems; Female; Glioblastoma; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Injections, Intravenous; Liposomes; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; Phthalic Anhydrides; Polyethylene Glycols; Polyethyleneimine; Protective Agents; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-84943178394

This nationwide cohort study investigated the risks of developing CKD and glomerulonephritis in patients with RA, and the associated risks for cardiovascular complications. Methods: From the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified a study cohort of 12,579 patients with RA and randomly selected 37,737 subjects without RA as a control cohort. Each subject was individually followed for up for 5 years, and the risk of CKD was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results: During the follow-up period, after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors RA was independently associated with a significantly increased risk of CKD (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-1.40) and glomerulonephritis (aHR 1.55; 95% CI 1.37-1.76). Increased risk of CKD was also associated with the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cyclosporine, glucocorticoids, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclophosphamide. Patients with comorbidities had even greater increased risk of CKD. Moreover, RA patients with concurrent CKD had significantly higher likelihood of developing ischemic heart disease and stroke. Conclusions: RA patients had higher risk of developing CKD and glomerulonephritis, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Their increased risk of CKD may be attributed to glomerulonephritis, chronic inflammation, comorbidities, and renal toxicity of antirheumatic drugs. Careful monitoring of renal function in RA patients and tight control of their comorbid diseases and cardiovascular risk factors are warranted. ? 2015 Chiu et al.",,"cyclophosphamide; cyclosporin; glucocorticoid; mycophenolate mofetil; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; antirheumatic agent; adult; aged; Article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; chronic inflammation; chronic kidney disease; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; drug use; end stage renal disease; female; follow up; glomerulonephritis; high risk population; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nephrotoxicity; obesity; population research; retrospective study; rheumatoid arthritis; risk assessment; survival rate; survival time; young adult; adolescent; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Cardiovascular Diseases; complication; factual database; health survey; incidence; Kaplan Meier method; mortality; proportional hazards model; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; risk; Taiwan; urbanization; very elderly; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Databases, Factual; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Population Surveillance; Proportional Hazards Models; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Risk; Taiwan; Urbanization; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84947708790

These inflammatory molecules could amplify the neuroinflammatory process and exacerbate neuronal injury. The aim of this study is to find out whether harpagoside could reduce hypoxia-induced microglia activation. Methods: In this study, primary microglia cells harvested from neonatal ICR mice were activated by exposure to hypoxia (1 % O2 for 3 h). Harpagoside had been shown to be no cytotoxicity on microglia cells by MTT assay. The scavenger effect of harpagoside on hypoxia-enhanced microglial cells proliferation, associated inflammatory genes expression (COX-II, IL-1β and IL-6 genes) and NO synthesis were also examined. Results: Hypoxia enhances active proliferation of microglial cells, while harpagoside can scavenge this effect. We find that harpagoside could scavenge hypoxia-enhanced inflammatory genes expression (COX-2, IL-1β and IL-6 genes) and NO synthesis of microglial cells. Under 3 h' hypoxic stimulation, the nuclear contents of p65 and hypoxia inducible factor-1aα (HIF-1aα) significantly increase, while the cytosol IkB-aα content decreases; these effects can be reversed by 1 h's pre-incubation of 10-8 M harpagoside. Harpagoside could decrease IkB-aα protein phosphorylation and inhibit p65 protein translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus, thus suppress NF-kB activation and reduce the HIF-1aα generation. Conclusion: These results suggested that the anti-inflammatory mechanism of harpagoside might be associated with the NF-kB signaling pathway. Harpagoside protect against hypoxia-induced toxicity on microglial cells through HIF-aα pathway. ? 2015 Sheu et al.",Activation; Anti-inflammation; Harpagoside; Hypoxia; Microglial cells,"complementary DNA; cyclooxygenase 2; harpagoside; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; I kappa B alpha; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; nitric oxide; RNA; synaptotagmin I; glycoside; harpagoside; plant extract; protective agent; pyran derivative; animal cell; Article; cell activation; cell nucleus; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; cytosol; DNA synthesis; drug effect; exposure; gene expression; hypoxia; microglia; mouse; neurotoxicity; newborn; nonhuman; protein phosphorylation; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; Western blotting; animal; chemistry; drug effects; inflammation; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; metabolism; microglia; Scrophularia; Animals; Gene Expression; Glycosides; Hypoxia; Inflammation; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Microglia; Plant Extracts; Protective Agents; Pyrans; Scrophularia",2-s2.0-84942196605

Methods. This pilot randomized controlled trial tested the effects of a walk-and-eat intervention for patients with esophageal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Participants with locally advanced esophageal cancer stage IIB or higher (n = 59) were randomly assigned to receive the walk-and-eat intervention (n = 30; nurse-supervised walking three times per week and weekly nutritional advice) or usual care (n = 29; control group) during 4–5 weeks of chemoradiotherapy. Primary endpoints were changes in distance on the 6-minute walk test, hand-grip strength, lean muscle mass, and body weight between initiation and completion of intervention. Results. Participants (mean age: 59.6 years) were mostly male (92.9%) with squamous cell carcinoma (96.4%). During chemoradiotherapy, participants who received the walk-and-eat intervention had 100-m less decline than controls in walk distance (adjusted p = .012), 3-kg less decrease in hand-grip strength (adjusted p = .002), and 2.7-kg less reduction in body weight (adjusted p < .001), regardless of age. The intervention group also had significantly lower rates of need for intravenous nutritional support and wheelchair use. Conclusion. The nurse-led walk-and-eat intervention is feasible and effective to preserve functional walking capacity and nutritional status for patients with esophageal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. ?

However, the function of this protein is still unclear. Methods: The clinical prognosis of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) patients and their clinical YKL-40 expressions were obtained from the Prognoscan database. The expressions of YKL-40 in patient samples were determined by Western Blotting assay. YKL-40 gene knockdown and overexpression were performed on NSCLC cancer cells (CL1-1 and CL1-5). The cells were investigated for their epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers gene modulation through Western Blotting and RT-PCR. Further cell metastatic abilities were assessed by transwell migration and invasion assay. Result: In this study, YKL-40 was observed to be highly expressed in NSCLC specimens. Furthermore, determined by the PrognoScan database analysis, patients with high expression levels of YKL-40 were found with poor prognosis. In the in vitro study, different characteristics of NSCLC cell lines (CL1-1, H23, H838, CL1-5, and H2009) were used as study models, where YKL-40 expression levels were determined to correlate with the phenotypic characteristics of cancer metastasis. In this study,YKL-40 was demonstrated to regulate EMT marker expressions such as Twist, Snail, Slug, N-cadherin, Vimentin, and E-cadherin. The protein's affects in cancer cell migration and invasion were also observed in YKL-40 overexpression or knock down NSCLC cell lines. Conclusion: All of results from this study suggest that YKL-40 is a major factor in NSCLC metastasis. Thus, YKL-40 may serve as therapeutic targets for NSCLC patients in the future. ? 2015 Jefri et al.",,"nerve cell adhesion molecule; protein kinase B; transcription factor Slug; transcription factor Snail; transcription factor Twist; uvomorulin; vimentin; adipocytokine; CHI3L1 protein, human; chitinase 3 like protein 1; lectin; Article; cancer prognosis; cell invasion; cell invasion assay; cell migration; cell migration assay; CL1 1 cell line; CL1 5 cell line; controlled study; correlation analysis; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene; gene expression; gene overexpression; gene silencing; human; human cell; in vitro study; lung cancer cell line; metastasis; non small cell lung cancer; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; stable expression; Western blotting; YKL 40 gene; cell motion; gene expression regulation; lung tumor; metabolism; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; prognosis; tumor cell line; Adipokines; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Chitinase-3-Like Protein 1; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Lectins; Lung Neoplasms; Neoplasm Metastasis; Prognosis",2-s2.0-84938915819

Here, we developed a simple synthesis reaction of ligands, hydrazine, and iron(ii) chloride to fabricate Fe3O4 cluster-structured nanoparticles (CNPs) with interesting NIR photonics and high magnetization (Ms: 98.3 emu g-1 and proton relaxivity r2: 234.6 mM-1 s-1). These Fe3O4 CNPs exhibited optical absorption and reflection over all wavelengths, showing a U-shape absorption band with a low absorbance at a range of 750-950 nm and a progressive evolution in the second near infrared region. Strengthening of the scattering effect by incubating Fe3O4 CNPs with HeLa cells was observed when optical contrast enhancement was performed in an optical coherence tomography (OCT) microscope system with a laser light source at 860 nm. Using a 1064 nm laser at a low power density (380 mW cm-2) to excite the Fe3O4 CNPs (375 ppm[Fe]) led to a rise in the water temperature from 25°C to 58°C within 10 min.

Maleic acid (MA), hydrolyzed from maleic anhydride, could cause kidney damages to animals. The potential health effects due to long-term MA exposures through food consumption have been of great concerns. Assessment of the dietary MA exposures could be very difficult and complicated. One of the alternatives is to analyze an MA-specific biomarker to assess the daily total MA intake. Therefore, this paper aimed to study the mercapturic acid of MA, 2-{[2-(acetylamino)-2-carboxyethyl]sulfanyl}butanedioic acid (MAMA), with our newly-developed isotope-dilution online solid-phase extraction liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (ID-SPE-LC-MS/MS) method. MAMA was first synthesized, purified, and characterized with NMR to reveal two diastereomers and used for developing the analytical method. The method was validated to reveal excellent sensitivity with a LOD at 16.3. ng/mL and a LOQ at 20.6. ng/mL and used to analyze MAMA in urine samples collected from Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a single dose of 0. mg/kg, 6. mg/kg, and 60. mg/kg (. n=. 5) of MA through gavage. Our results show dose-dependent increases in urinary MAMA contents, and 70% MAMA was excreted within 12. h with no gender differences (. p>. 0.05). A half life of urinary MAMA was estimated at 6.8. h for rat. The formation of urinary MAMA validates it as a chemically-specific biomarker for current MA exposure. Future study of MA metabolism in vivo will elucidate mechanisms of MAMA formation, and analysis of this marker in epidemiology studies could help to shed light on the causal effects of MA on human. ? 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Detoxication; LC-MS/MS; Maleic acid; Mercapturic acid,"2 [[2 (acetylamino) 2 carboxyethyl]sulfanyl] butanedioic acid; acetylcysteine; biological marker; food additive; maleic acid; maleic anhydride; succinic acid; unclassified drug; 2-((2-(acetylamino-2-carboxyethyl)sulfanyl)butanedioic acid; acetylcysteine; biological marker; maleic acid; maleic acid derivative; succinic acid derivative; analytic method; animal experiment; Article; controlled study; diastereoisomer; dilution; excretion; female; food intake; half life time; kidney injury; liquid chromatography; male; mass spectrometry; metabolism; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; purification; quantitative analysis; rat; sex difference; solid phase extraction; synthesis; urinalysis; urine volume; validation study; analogs and derivatives; animal; dose response; metabolism; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Sprague Dawley rat; urine; Animalia; Rattus; Acetylcysteine; Animals; Biological Markers; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Maleates; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Succinates",2-s2.0-84929614859

Methods: All coding exons and at least 20 bp of flanking intronic sequences of 236 genes causing NMDs were enriched by using SeqCap EZ solution-based capture and enrichment method followed by massively parallel sequencing on Illumina HiSeq2000. Results: The target gene capture/deep sequencing provides an average coverage of ?1,000× per nucleotide. Thirty-five unrelated NMD families (38 patients) with clinical and/or muscle pathologic diagnoses but without identified causative genetic defects were analyzed. Deleterious mutations were found in 29 families (83%). Definitive causative mutations were identified in 21 families (60%) and likely diagnoses were established in 8 families (23%). Six families were left without diagnosis due to uncertainty in phenotype/genotype correlation and/or unidentified causative genes. Using this comprehensive panel, we not only identified mutations in expected genes but also expanded phenotype/genotype among different subcategories of NMDs. Conclusions: Target gene capture/deep sequencing approach can greatly improve the genetic diagnosis of NMDs. This study demonstrated the power of NGS in confirming and expanding clinical phenotypes/genotypes of the extremely heterogeneous NMDs. Confirmed molecular diagnoses of NMDs can assist in genetic counseling and carrier detection as well as guide therapeutic. ? 2015 American Academy of Neurology options for treatable disorders.",,acylcarnitine; alpha actinin 1; alpha sarcoglycan; binding protein; calpain 3; carnitine; carnitine acylcarnitine translocase; carrier protein; chloride channel 1 muscle; connectin; DNA; dysferlin; emerin; envelope protein; immunoglobulin; immunoglobulin mu binding protein 2; laminin alpha2; mitofusin 2; myosin heavy chain; myosin heavy chain 2 muscle adult; myosin heavy chain 7 cardiac muscle beta; myotonic dystrophy protein kinase; myotubularin; nebulin; protein; protein o mannosyltransferase 1; ryanodine receptor 1; selenoprotein N1; spectrin; spectrin repeat containing nuclear envelope protein 1; unclassified drug; adolescent; adult; Article; child; clinical article; congenital myopathy; female; gene identification; gene mutation; gene targeting; genetic analysis; genotype phenotype correlation; human; ion channel muscle disease; limb girdle muscular dystrophy; male; middle aged; molecular pathology; myopathy; myotonic dystrophy; neuromuscular disease; neuropathology; next generation sequencing; preschool child; priority journal; school child; sequence alignment; young adult,2-s2.0-84969153078

We also found that the ERK and JNK signaling pathways were involved in the regulation of IL-8-mediated COX-2 induction in response to HCV infection. Using a promoter-linked reporter assay, we identified that the C/EBP regulatory element within the COX-2 promoter was the dominant factor responsible for the induction of COX-2 by HCV.

Under such a disease etiology, assuming one disease locus in linkage disequilibrium mapping is likely to induce bias and lead to efficiency loss in disease locus estimation. An approach is needed for simultaneously localizing multiple functional loci within the same region. However, due to the increasing number of parameters accompanying disease loci, these estimates can be computationally infeasible. To circumvent this problem, we propose to estimate the main and two-adjacent-locus joint effects and a nuisance parameter at the disease loci separately through a linear approximation. Estimates of the genetic effects are entered into a generalized estimating equation to estimate disease loci, and the procedure is conducted iteratively until convergence. The proposed method provides estimates and confidence intervals (CIs) for the disease loci, the genetic main effects, and the joint effects of two adjacent disease loci, with the CIs for the disease loci providing useful regions for further fine-mapping. We apply the proposed approach to a data example of case-control studies. Results of the simulations and data example suggest that the developed method performs well in terms of bias, variance, and coverage probability under scenarios with up to three disease loci. ? 2014 The Author.

Methods This is a population-based cohort administrative database study. Randomly selected 1,000,000 residents from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database in 2000 and followed for 12 years to determine the population incidence of NTSCH. Individuals with the first diagnosis of subconjunctival hemorrhage were identified by the corresponding International Classification of Diseases code (ICD) 372.72. Traumatic subconjunctival hemorrhages (ICD-9 codes 921, 871, 850-854 and 959.01) were excluded. The association of NTSCH with various demographic factors, comorbidities and use of medications was studied by a population based case-control analysis using data of 2008-2011. Results A total of 67,720 patients with a first-time diagnosis of NTSCH were identified during the 12 years period. The mean annual incidence was 65 per 10,000 individuals (crude incidence) and 60 per 10,000 individuals (age- and sex-standardized incidence). The incidence rate of NTSCH was higher in women than in men, [men-women ratio: 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.78-0.81)]. The age-specific incidence decreased from childhood to the group of teenagers, after which it increased to a maximal value of 136.2 per 10,000 people in the age group of 60-69 years. Case-control analysis showed that comorbidities of hypertension, purpura and thrombocytopenia, and the use of aspirin were significantly associated with the risk of NTSCH. Conclusions This study indicates that NTSCH is a common eye disease that occurs once in 167 individuals in a general East Asian population per year.

Whereas earlier studies have proposed various approaches to reduce the adverse effects of unobserved heterogeneity, this study proposes accelerated failure time (AFT) models of accident duration with flexible distributions of the error term and the frailty parameter. A two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) method for identifying the effects of endogenous variable in the nonlinear AFT models is adopted. The Taiwanese freeway accident databases were used to evaluate the applicability of the proposed approach. The results reveal that AFT models with a non-monotone Log-logistic error term distribution and a gamma frailty parameter distribution outperformed those with other assumed distributions. Number of lanes blocked was found as a significant endogenous variable to accident duration; the endogenous variable effect, if not accounted for or accounted by traditional two-stage least squares estimators, would underestimate the effect of the number of lanes blocked on accident duration. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Accident duration; Number of lanes blocked; Simultaneous equation modeling; Traffic accidents,Highway accidents; Accelerated failure time model (AFT); Accident management; Number of lanes; Parameter distributions; Simultaneous equation modeling; Two-stage least squares estimator; Unbiased estimates; Unobserved heterogeneity; Accidents,2-s2.0-84936878600

Hepatoma-derived growth factor (hHDGF) and HDGF-related proteins (HRPs) contain conserved N-terminal HATH domains with a characteristic structural motif, namely the PWWP motif. The HATH domain has attracted attention because of its ability to bind with heparin/heparan sulfate, DNA, and methylated histone peptide. Depending on the sequence of the PWWP motif, HRP HATHs are classified into P-type (Pro-His-Trp-Pro) and A-type (Ala-His-Trp-Pro) forms. A-type HATH is highly unstable and tends to precipitate in solution. We replaced the Pro residue in P-type HATH HDGF with Ala and evaluated the influence on structure, dynamics, and ligand binding. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) hydrogen/deuterium exchange and circular dichroism (CD) measurements revealed reduced stability. Analysis of NMR backbone 15 N relaxations (R 1 , R 2 , and nuclear Overhauser effect) revealed additional backbone dynamics in the interface between the β-barrel and the C-terminal helix bundle. The β1-β2 loop, where the AHWP sequence is located, has great structural flexibility, which aids HATH-HATH interaction through the loop. A-type HATH, therefore, shows a stronger tendency to aggregate when binding with heparin and DNA oligomers. This study defines the role of the first residue of the PWWP motif in modulating HATH domain stability and oligomer formation in binding. ? 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Bins; Dichroism; DNA sequences; Oligomers; Polysaccharides; Proteins; Chemical equations; Hepatoma-derived growth factors; Hydrogen/Deuterium exchange; Nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR); Nuclear overhauser effects; Oligomer formations; Protein-protein interactions; Structural flexibilities; Nuclear magnetic resonance; amino acid; deuterium; DNA; heparan sulfate; hepatoma derived growth factor; histone methyltransferase; hydrogen; low molecular weight heparin; oligomer; DNA; heparin; hepatoma-derived growth factor; protein binding; signal peptide; Article; circular dichroism; controlled study; deuterium hydrogen exchange; heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance; heteronuclear single quantum coherence; histone methylation; ligand binding; molecular weight; oligomerization; point mutation; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein binding; protein conformation; protein domain; protein expression; protein motif; protein protein interaction; protein secondary structure; protein stability; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; sequence alignment; site directed mutagenesis; thermostability; amino acid sequence; chemical structure; chemistry; human; metabolism; molecular genetics; protein domain; Amino Acid Sequence; DNA; Heparin; Humans; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Protein Stability; Sequence Alignment",2-s2.0-84936792247

In this work, SR-IR is applied in the study of the lung cancer cells in different cell cycles. Methods: We use a novel synchrotron based radiation infrared system combined synchronized model human lung carcinoma to reveal its unique character pattern. Results: After using SR-IR microspectroscopy, we discovered that the ratio of protein to lipid in G1 and G2 states is around 4.0 and 6.1, respectively. Moreover, for the DNA at the wavenumber position of 1225 cm-1, the intensity ratio of G2 state to G1 state is approximately 1.6. These data indicate that the cell in G1 state has more lipid composition to prepare for the DNA synthesis, but the cell in G2 state has more protein composition to prepare for the mitosis. The cell has larger DNA concentration in G2 state, which can be explained for the DNA synthesis. Conclusion: Through our research, we demonstrate that different growth state of cancer cell presenting unique functional groups concentration profiles and distribution via using SR-IR microspectrometry.

Xenobiotic accumulation can induce a variety of diseases, including cancers. Sulfation facilitates the solubilization and removal of xenobiotics. However, sulfation may activate the pharmacological activities of xenobiotics.Areas covered: The purpose of this review was to correlate the sequence, structure and function of SULTs. We focused on understanding the sulfation mechanisms of SULT through its sequence variation. We selectively reviewed SULT drug substrates, explained the enzyme-catalyzed sulfation reaction and its kinetic mechanisms, and the effect of amino acid sequence variation, such as single-nucleotide polymorphism, on the enzyme function.Expert opinion: A wealth of information is available in the literature for understanding the detailed mechanisms underlying xenobiotic sulfation. We reviewed information regarding the sequence, structure and reaction mechanism of SULTs and explained how SULT activities altered. In addition to revealing the SULT kinetics, the mRNA expression of specific SULTs in tissues that revealed their distribution in tissues also affects overall SULT activities. Understanding of the structure-function relationship and the reaction mechanism of SULTs is valuable for understanding, preventing and treating diseases. ?

In particular, the model considers the linear combination of three possible routes of disease propagation between infected and susceptible individuals as well as two possible transmission types which describe how the susceptible vectors attack the infected individuals. A new technique based on the basic reproduction matrix is introduced to obtain the following results. First, necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for the global stability of the model through a unified approach. As a result, we are able to produce the exact basic reproduction number and the precise epidemic thresholds with respect to three spreading strengths, the curing strength or the immunization strength all at once. Second, the monotonicity of the basic reproduction number and the above mentioned epidemic thresholds with respect to all other parameters can be rigorously characterized. Finally, we are able to compare the effectiveness of various immunization strategies under the assumption that the number of persons getting vaccinated is the same for all strategies. In particular, we prove that in the scale-free networks, both targeted and acquaintance immunizations are more effective than uniform and active immunizations and that active immunization is the least effective strategy among those four. We are also able to determine how the vaccine should be used at minimum to control the outbreak of the disease. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our profiling reveals that RA and EGCG selectively inhibit 3% (EGFR and SYK) and 14% of 64 kinases, respectively. According to the guide of our anchor model, we synthesized three RA derivatives with better potency.

After PCR, the DMD amplicons reacted with copper ion by reduction of ascorbic acid and generated fluorescence. The exons of the DMD gene were taken as the model analytes for genetic diagnosis. In this sensing system, the deletion type does not show fluorescence; on the other hand, the duplication type emits higher fluorescence than normal type. Parameters of this sensing system were optimized, including PCR conditions, levels of copper ion and ascorbate, and reaction time.

The proposed design has several advantages such as lower group delay, lower computational complexity, and lower matching error. The technique we developed in this paper can be summarized as follows: 1) a simple low-pass filter (LPF) and discrete cosine transform (DCT) modulation are utilized to generate a uniform 9-band filterbank first, and then all elements of ${\rm z}-1 are replaced by all-pass filters to obtain a non-uniform filterbank; 2) a fast recursive structure and variable-length algorithm is further developed to efficiently accomplish DCT modulation. Thus, the spectrum of LPF can be easily spanned and flexibly extended to the location of the desired central frequency; 3) after employing the multi-rate algorithm, an 18-band non-uniform filterbank is generated from two 9-band sub filterbanks by following the proposed design steps and parameter determinations. Compared with the latest Liu 's quasi-class-2 ANSI S1.11 design, the proposed method-I (Proposed-I) totally has 72.8% reduction for multiplications per sample, 11.25-ms group delay, and 59 additions decreased per sample. Moreover, the maximum matching error of the proposed method-II (Proposed-II) is averagely equal to 1.79 dB much smaller than that of the latest Wei 's design. For the proposed variable-length DCT modulation, only 2 adders, 2 multipliers, 2 multiplexers, and 5 registers are required for hardware implementation after applying VLSI retiming scheme. Overall, the proposed filterbank design would be a new solution for future applications in the area of hearing aids. ? 2004-2012 IEEE.",ANSI S1.11; digital hearing aids; discrete cosine transform (DCT) modulation; filterbank,Algorithms; All-pass filters; Audition; Computational complexity; Design; Discrete cosine transforms; Filter banks; Group delay; Hardware; Hearing aids; Low pass filters; ANSI S1.11; Architecture designs; Digital hearing aids; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); Hardware implementations; Low complexity algorithm; Multi-rate algorithm; Parameter determination; Modulation,2-s2.0-85027934893

In this study, the development of a NP formulation that can meet all these challenging requirements for targeted glioblastoma multiform (GBM) therapy is reported. This multifunctional NP is composed of a polyethylene glycol-coated magnetic iron oxide NP conjugated with cyclodextrin and chlorotoxin (CTX) and loaded with fluorescein and paclitaxel (PTX) (IONP-PTX-CTX-FL). The physicochemical properties of the IONP-PTX-CTX-FL are characterized by transmission electron microscope, dynamic light scattering, and high-performance liquid chromatography. The cellular uptake of NPs is studied using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Cell viability and apoptosis are assessed with the Alamar Blue viability assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The IONP-PTX-CTX-FL had a uniform size of ?44 nm and high stability in cell culture medium. Importantly, the presence of CTX on NPs enhanced the uptake of the NPs by GBM cells and improved the efficacy of PTX in killing both GBM and GBM drug-resistant cells.

We add travel socialization theory regarding parental influence on vehicle usage to enhance previous structural models describing motorcycle usage behavior. Our newly developed model was empirically verified in a sample of 721 motorcycle users in Taiwan. In addition to instrumental, symbolic, and affective motivations, perceived parental attitudes (PPAs) towards motorcycle riding were found to have a significant effect on individuals' motorcycle use habits. Additionally, participants who perceived their parents to have more positive attitudes toward motorcycles were found to have more experience being chauffeured on motorcycles by their parents. Based on these results, we suggest means to confront the challenges brought on by the rapid growth of motorcycle usage, especially serious motorcycle traffic accidents. These results improve our understanding motorcycle usage in Taiwan and can be used by transportation professionals who are seeking solutions to the rapid growth of motorcycle usage. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect of anti-diabetic therapy (ADT) on carcinogenesis among diabetic patients is also unclear. Materials and Methods: Using population-based representative insurance claims data in Taiwan, 36,270 DM patients and 145,080 comparison subjects without DM were identified from claims from 2005 to 2010. The association between the top ten leading causes of cancer-related death in Taiwan and DM was evaluated. Whether ADT altered the risk of developing cancer was also investigated. Results: Incidence of cancer at any site was significantly higher in patients with DM than in those without (p<0.001). The risk of carcinogenesis imparted by DMwas greatest in gastroenterological malignancies (liver, pancreas, and colorectal cancer) as well as lung, breast and oral cancer (p<0.001). Among the oral types of ADT, metformin decreased the risk of lung and liver cancer, but had less effect on reducing the risk of colorectal cancer. α-glucosidase inhibitor decreased the risk of developing liver, colorectal, and breast cancer. Apart from intermediateacting insulin, rapid-acting, long-acting, and combination insulin treatment significantly reduced the overall cancer risk among all DM patients. In subgroup analysis, long-acting insulin treatment significantly decreased the risk of lung, liver, and colorectal cancer. Conclusion: Our results supported the notion that pre-existing DM increases the incidence of gastroenterological cancer. ADT, especially metformin, α-glucosidase inhibitor, and long-acting insulin treatment, may protect patients with DM against these malignancies. It is crucial that oncologists should closely collaborate with endocrinologists to provide an optimal cancerspecific therapy and diabetic treatment to patients simultaneously with cancer and DM. ? 2015 Lin et al.",,"alpha glucosidase inhibitor; glitazone derivative; insulin; meglitinide; metformin; sulfonylurea derivative; antidiabetic agent; glycosidase inhibitor; long acting insulin; metformin; adult; antidiabetic therapy; Article; breast cancer; cancer incidence; cancer localization; cancer risk; chemotherapy; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; comorbidity; comparative study; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; digestive system cancer; disease association; dyslipidemia; female; gout; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; human; hypertension; insulin treatment; liver cancer; liver cirrhosis; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mouth cancer; obesity; pancreas cancer; population research; retrospective study; risk reduction; Taiwan; young adult; Colorectal Neoplasms; diabetes mellitus; incidence; Liver Neoplasms; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Adult; Cohort Studies; Colorectal Neoplasms; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incidence; Insulin, Long-Acting; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Metformin; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84929339047

However, trehalose is digested into glucose by trehalase and which reduced its efficacy in the disease target tissues. Therefore, searching trehalase-indigestible analogs of trehalose is a potential strategy to enhance therapeutic effect. In this study, two trehalase-indigestible trehalose analogs, lactulose and melibiose, were selected through compound topology and functional group analyses. Hydrogen-bonding network analyses suggest that the elimination of the hydrogen bond between the linker ether and aspartate 321 (D321) of human trehalase is the key for lactulose and melibiose to avoid the hydrolyzation. Using polyQ-mediated spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) cell and slice cultures, we found the aggregation was significantly prohibited by trehalose, lactulose, and melibiose, which may through up-regulating of autophagy.

We focus on improving the detection limit of LC-based immunoassay techniques by surface modification of the surfactant alignment layer consisting of dimethyloctadecyl[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ammonium chloride (DMOAP). The cancer biomarker CA125 was detected with an array of anti-CA125 antibodies immobilized on the ultraviolet (UV)-modified DMOAP monolayer. Compared with a pristine counterpart, UV irradiation enhanced the binding affinity of the CA125 antibody and reproducibility of immunodetection in which a detection limit of 0.01 ng Mml for the cancer biomarker CA125 was achieved. Additionally, the optical texture observed under a crossed polarized microscope was correlated with the analyte concentration. In a proof-of-concept experiment using CA125- spiked human serum as the analyte, specific binding between the CA125 antigen and the anti-CA125 antibody resulted in a distinct and concentration-dependent optical response despite the high background caused by nonspecific binding of other biomolecules in the human serum. Results from this study indicate that UV modification of the alignment layer, as well as detection with LCs of large birefringence, contributes to the enhanced performance of the label-free LC-based immunodetection, which may be considered a promising alternative to conventional label-based methods. ? 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.",CA125; cancer biomarker; label-free immunodetection; liquid-crystal-based immunodetection,"Alignment; Antibodies; Antigens; Binding energy; Bins; Body fluids; Chlorine compounds; Diseases; Immunology; Irradiation; Liquid crystals; Liquids; Surface treatment; Analyte concentration; CA125; Cancer biomarkers; Concentration-dependent; Immunoassay techniques; Immunodetection; Non-specific binding; Ultraviolet irradiations; Chemical detection; CA 125 antigen; membrane protein; MUC16 protein, human; tumor marker; blood; chemistry; device failure analysis; devices; equipment design; human; immunoassay; immunology; liquid crystal; radiation response; refractometry; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; surface property; ultraviolet radiation; Biomarkers, Tumor; CA-125 Antigen; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Humans; Immunoassay; Liquid Crystals; Membrane Proteins; Refractometry; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Surface Properties; Ultraviolet Rays",2-s2.0-84929998243

A magnetic CDDP-encapsulated nanocapsule (CDDP-PAA-NC) with CDDP-polyacrylic acid (PAA) core in amphiphilic polyvinyl alcohol/superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles shell is synthesized through a double emulsion to provide both high loading efficiency and controlled drug release. The CDDP-PAA-NCs significantly increase the blood circulation time of CDDP in vivo, with nearly 100-fold higher concentration, and drastically reduce side effects, including nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, compared with the delivery of free CDDP. Furthermore, with a magnetic targeting effect, the CDDP-PAA-NCs show ninefold higher level accumulation in tumor tissue than the free CDDP treatment when administered at the equivalent dose, and mice treated with the CDDP-PAA-NCs display approximately 3.5-fold lower tumor volume than those of the control group on day 24. This result demonstrates that the magnetic CDDP-PAA-NCs, which are synthesized using a facile emulsion process, can significantly reduce toxicity and exhibit anticancer activity in A549-tumor bearing mice with negligible side effects.

It is assumed that the individual vaccination behavior depends on the contact awareness, local and global information of an epidemic. To better simulate the real situation, the vaccine failure rate is also taken into consideration. Our main conclusions are given in the following. First, we show that if the vaccine failure rate α is zero, then the epidemic eventually dies out regardless of what the network structure is or how large the effective spreading rate and the immunization response rates of an epidemic are. Second, we show that for any positive α, there exists a positive epidemic threshold depending on an adjusted network structure, which is only determined by the structure of the original network, the positive vaccine failure rate and the immunization response rate for contact awareness. Moreover, the epidemic threshold increases with respect to the strength of the immunization response rate for contact awareness. Finally, if the vaccine failure rate and the immunization response rate for contact awareness are positive, then there exists a critical vaccine failure rate αc &gt; 0 so that the disease free equilibrium (DFE) is stable (resp., unstable) if α &lt; αc (resp., α &gt; αc).

These emissions contain an abundance of toxic metals and thus pose adverse effects on human health. Size-fractionated aerosol samples were collected from May to September 2013 by using micro-orifice uniform deposited impactors (MOUDIs). Sample collection was conducted simultaneously at the inlet and outlet sites of Hsuehshan Tunnel in northern Taiwan, which is the second-longest freeway tunnel (12.9 km) in Asia. This endeavor aims to characterize the chemical constituents and size distributions, as well as fingerprinting ratios of particulate metals emitted by vehicle fleets. A total of 36 metals in size-resolved aerosols were determined through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Three major groups - namely, tailpipe emissions (Zn, Pb, and V in fine mode), wear debris (Cu, Cd, Fe, Ga, Mn, Mo, Sb, and Sn), and resuspended dust (Ca, Mg, K, and Rb) - of airborne PM metals were categorized on the basis of the results of enrichment factor, correlation matrix, and principal component analysis. Size distributions of wear-originated metals resembled the pattern of crustal elements, which were predominated by super-micron particulates (PM<inf>1-10</inf>). By contrast, tailpipe exhaust elements such as Zn, Pb, and V were distributed mainly in submicron particles. By employing Cu as a tracer of wear abrasion, several inter-metal ratios - including Fe / Cu (14), Ba / Cu (1.05), Sb / Cu (0.16), Sn / Cu (0.10), and Ga / Cu (0.03) - served as fingerprints for wear debris.

The nanocarriers were characterized with regard to size with dynamic light scattering, SEM, and TEM. The characterization confirmed the nanocarriers to have a surface coating of the anti-EGFR antibody and a final size excellently suited for circulating targeting nanocarriers, i.e., <200 nm in diameter. In vitro drug release revealed extended quasi-Fickian release from the nanocarriers, with the anti-EGFR layer further reducing the release rate. Cell culture experiments using normoxic and MDR hypoxic cells overexpressing EGFR confirmed improved DMC delivery for anti-EGFR coated particles and revealed that the DMC was delivered to the cytoplasmic region of the cells, forming nanoprecipitates in lysosomes and endosomes. The effective endocytosis and targeting of the core-shell nanoparticles resulted in the nanocarriers achieving high cytotoxicity also against MDR cells. The therapeutic potential was further confirmed in an A549 xenograft lung tumor mouse model, where DMC loaded core-shell nanocarriers achieved about 8-fold reduction in tumor volume compared with control group over the 8 weeks of the investigation. Both in vitro and in vivo data suggest the anti-EGFR coated core-shell nanocarriers as highly promising for treatment of hypoxic MDR cancers, especially for non-small cell lung cancer. ? 2015 American Chemical Society.",amphiphilic chitosan; demethoxycurcumin; drug release; multidrug resistant; non-small cell lung cancer cell,"antibody; chitosan nanoparticle; demethoxycurcumin; epidermal growth factor receptor antibody; chitosan; curcumin; demethoxycurcumin; drug carrier; epidermal growth factor receptor; nanoparticle; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cell culture; coated particle; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; drug release; dynamic light scattering; endocytosis; endosome; experimental model; hypoxic cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; light scattering; lung cancer; lysosome; mouse; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; transmission electron microscopy; tumor volume; analogs and derivatives; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cancer transplantation; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; chemistry; cytoplasm; drug delivery system; human; IC50; light; Lung Neoplasms; metabolism; nanomedicine; nude mouse; radiation scattering; tumor cell line; Animals; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Chitosan; Curcumin; Cytoplasm; Drug Carriers; Drug Delivery Systems; Humans; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Light; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Nanomedicine; Nanoparticles; Neoplasm Transplantation; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor; Scattering, Radiation",2-s2.0-84926472847

In ovarian cancer, benign tumors turn malignant, but the point of transition is difficult to predict and diagnose. The 5-year survival rate of all types of ovarian cancer is 44%, but this can be improved to 92% if the cancer is found and treated before it spreads beyond the ovary. However, only 15% of all ovarian cancers are found at this early stage. Therefore, the ability to automatically identify and diagnose ovarian cancer precisely and efficiently as the tissue changes from benign to invasive is important for clinical treatment and for increasing the cure rate. This study proposes a new ovarian carcinoma classification model using two algorithms: a novel discretization of food sources for an artificial bee colony (DfABC), and a support vector machine (SVM). For the first time in the literature, oncogene detection using this method is also investigated. Results: A novel bio-inspired computing model and hybrid algorithms combining DfABC and SVM was applied to ovarian carcinoma and oncogene classification. This study used the human ovarian cDNA expression database to collect 41 patient samples and 9600 genes in each pathological stage. Feature selection methods were used to detect and extract 15 notable oncogenes. We then used the DfABC-SVM model to examine these 15 oncogenes, dividing them into eight different classifications according to their gene expressions of various pathological stages. The average accuracyof the eight classification experiments was 94.76%. This research also found some oncogenes that had not been discovered or indicated in previous scientific studies. The main contribution of this research is the proof that these newly discovered oncogenes are highly related to ovarian or other cancers. ?

The GPGPU design philosophy allocates most of the chip area to processing cores, and thus results in a relatively small cache shared by a large number of cores when compared with conventional multi-core CPUs. Applying a proper thread mapping scheme is crucial for gaining from constructive cache sharing and avoiding resource contention among thousands of threads. However, due to the significant differences on architectures and programming models, the existing thread mapping approaches for multi-core CPUs do not perform as effective on GPGPUs. This paper proposes a formal model to capture both the characteristics of threads as well as the cache sharing behavior of multi-level shared cache. With appropriate proofs, the model forms a solid theoretical foundation beneath the proposed cache hierarchy aware thread mapping methodology for multi-level shared cache GPGPUs. The experiments reveal that the three-staged thread mapping methodology can successfully improve the data reuse on each cache level of GPGPUs and achieve an average of 2.3× to 4.3× runtime enhancement when compared with existing approaches. ? 2014 IEEE.",cache memories; Multithreaded processors; performance analysis and design aids; shared memory,Buffer storage; Computer architecture; Mapping; Multicore programming; Program processors; Gpgpu architectures; Mapping methodology; Multi-level hierarchies; Multithreaded processors; Performance analysis and design aids; Resource contention; Shared memory; Theoretical foundations; Cache memory,2-s2.0-84925071240

It has been suggested that chemotactic gradients attract neutrophils, leading to extravasation, but recent findings also implicate vascular hydrodynamic forces in chemotactic responses. With this motivation, we developed a Labchip that mimics the dynamic three-dimensional microenvironment of a blood vessel. This capillary-endothelium-mimetic (CEM) microfluidic chip serves as a dynamic transwell system for studying neutrophil migration at different flow velocities. Under lower flow rates, the chemotactic factor dominates over the flow rate, increasing the extravasation of neutrophil-like cells; at higher flow rates, the neutrophil-like cells aggregate near the side wall of the chamber due to a hydrodynamic force, limiting extravasation. In this report, we demonstrate the use of this Labchip for studying extravasation behavior over an extended period of time, under conditions of continuous flow and a stable concentration gradient. This Labchip-based approach is also applicable to the study of cancer metastasis, atherosclerosis and other angiopathies. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We found that the amount of ConA-SCHS complex binding to hepatoma cells was significantly higher than that seen with normal hepatocytes, based on flow cytometric analysis and confocal imaging. Hepatoma cells incubated with ConA-SCHSs were thus more easily killed by the subsequent irradiation with a NIR laser.

One of the central difficulties in identifying biomarkers from microarray data is the availability of only a small number of samples, which results overtraining. Recently obtained evidence reveals that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tumor cells causes metastasis, which is detrimental to patients' survival. Results: This work proposes a novel optimization approach to discovering EMT-related prognostic biomarkers to predict the distant metastasis of lung cancer using both microarray and survival data. This weighted objective function maximizes both the accuracy of prediction of distant metastasis and the area between the disease-free survival curves of the non-distant and distant metastases. Seventy-eight patients with lung cancer and a follow-up time of 120months are used to identify a set of gene markers and an independent cohort of 26 patients is used to evaluate the identified biomarkers. The medical records of the 78 patients show a significant difference between the disease-free survival times of the 37 non-distant- and the 41 distant-metastasis patients. The experimental results thus obtained are as follows. 1) The use of disease-free survival curves can compensate for the shortcoming of insufficient samples and greatly increase the test accuracy by 11.10%; and 2) the support vector machine with a set of 17 transcripts, such as CCL16 and CDKN2AIP, can yield a leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy of 93.59%, a test accuracy of 76.92%, a large disease-free survival area of 74.81%, and a mean survival prediction error of 3.99months. The identified putative biomarkers are examined using related studies and signaling pathways to reveal the potential effectiveness of the biomarkers in prospective confirmatory studies. Conclusions: The proposed new optimization approach to identifying prognostic biomarkers by combining multiple sources of data (microarray and survival) can facilitate the accurate selection of biomarkers that are most relevant to the disease while solving the problem of insufficient samples. ?

This study presents an analytical method based on the affinity nanoprobe-based mass spectrometry that enables detection of S. aureus in aqueous samples. A peptide aptamer DVFLGDVFLGDEC (DD) that can recognize S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was used as the reducing agent and protective group to generate DD-immobilized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs@DD) from one-pot reactions. The thiol group from cysteine in the peptide aptamer, i.e., DD, can interact with gold ions to generate DD-immobilized AuNPs in an alkaline solution. The generated AuNPs@DD has an absorption maximum at ?518 nm. The average particle size is 7.6 ± 1.2 nm. Furthermore, the generated AuNPs@DD can selectively bind with S. aureus and MRSA. The conjugates of the target bacteria with AuNPs were directly analyzed by surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (SALDI-MS). The gold ions generated from the AuNPs@DD anchored on the target bacteria were monitored. Gold ions (m/z 197 and 394) were only generated from the conjugates of the target bacterium-AuNP@DD in the SALDI process. Thus, the gold ions could be used as the indicators for the presence of the target bacteria. The detection limit of S. aureus using this method is in the order of a few tens of cells. The low detection limit is due to the ease of generation of gold cluster ion derived from AuNPs under irradiation with a 355 nm laser beam. Apple juice mixed with S. aureus was used as the sample to demonstrate the suitability of the method for real-world application. Because of its low detection limit, this approach can potentially be used to screen the presence of S. aureus in complex samples. ? 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Amino acids; Bacteria; Desorption; Fruit juices; Gold; Ions; Laser beams; Mass spectrometry; Metal nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Particle size; Peptides; Spectrometry; Alkaline solutions; Average particle size; Functional gold nanoparticles; Infectious disease; Low detection limit; Pathogenic bacterium; Staphylococcus aureus; Surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization; Gold compounds; gold; metal nanoparticle; peptide; peptide aptamer; reducing agent; amino acid sequence; beverage; chemistry; evaluation study; human; isolation and purification; limit of detection; mass spectrometry; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; microbiology; procedures; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus infection; ultrastructure; Amino Acid Sequence; Aptamers, Peptide; Beverages; Gold; Humans; Limit of Detection; Metal Nanoparticles; Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Peptides; Reducing Agents; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Staphylococcal Infections; Staphylococcus aureus",2-s2.0-84923123316

From the virtual screening, 48 compounds were selected and subjected to the Akt kinase inhibition assay. Twenty-six of the test compounds showed more potent inhibitory effects on Akt kinase than the reference compound, H-89. These 26 compounds were further evaluated for their cytotoxicity against HCT-116 human colon cancer cells and HEK-293 normal human embryonic kidney cells. Twelve compounds were found to display more potent or comparable cytotoxic activity compared to compound H-89 against HCT-116 colon cancer cells. The best results were obtained with Compounds a46 and a48 having IC50 values (for HCT-116) of 11.1 and 9.5 ?M, respectively, and selectivity indices (IC50 for HEK-293/IC50 for HCT-116) of 12.5 and 16.1, respectively.

Protein tyrosine sulfation (PTS) is a common post-translational modification that was first reported in the literature fifty years ago. However, the significance of PTS under physiological conditions and its link to diseases have just begun to be appreciated in recent years. PTS is catalyzed by tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST) through transfer of an activated sulfate from 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate to tyrosine in a variety of proteins and peptides. Currently, only a small fraction of sulfated proteins is known and the understanding of the biological sulfation mechanisms is still in progress. In this review, we give an introductory and selective brief review of PTS and then summarize the basic biochemical information including the activity and the preparation of TPST, methods for the determination of PTS, and kinetics and reaction mechanism of TPST.

FastICA is an efficient algorithm to compute ICA. To reduce the energy dissipation, eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) is utilized in the preprocessing stage to reduce the convergence time of iterative calculation of ICA components. EVD is computed efficiently through an array structure of processing elements running in parallel. Area-efficient EVD architecture is realized by leveraging the approximate Jacobi algorithm, leading to a 77.2% area reduction. By choosing proper memory element and reduced wordlength, the power and area of storage memory are reduced by 95.6% and 51.7%, respectively. The chip area is minimized through fixed-point implementation and architectural transformations. Given a latency constraint of 0.1 s, an 86.5% area reduction is achieved compared to the direct-mapped architecture. Fabricated in 90 nm CMOS, the core area of the chip is 0.40 .

Methods: Study subjects were members of the Beaver Dam Offspring Study (BOSS), a longitudinal study of adult children of participants in the population-based Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study (1993-present). BOSS examinations took place in 2005-2008 (baseline) and 2010-2013 (5-year follow-up). The 5-year incidence of hearing impairment was defined as a pure-tone average (PTA) of thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2 and 4kHz>25dB Hearing Level (dB HL) in either ear at follow-up among participants at risk (baseline PTA in both ears<= 25dB HL; n=2436, mean age=47.7 years).

Results: Among the 1984 participants at-risk with a follow-up audiometric examination, the 5-year incidence of hearing impairment was 8.3% (95% Confidence Interval (C.I.) 7.1, 9.5). With multivariable adjustment, carotid intima-media thickness was positively associated with hearing impairment incidence (Relative Risk (RR)=1.14 per 0.1mm, 95% C.I. 1.04, 1.24).

Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that is capable of inducing chondrocytes and synovial cells to synthesize MMPs. The hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha (HIF-2alpha, encoded by Epas1) is the catabolic transcription factor in the osteoarthritic process. The purpose of this study is to validate the effects of ecdysteroids (Ecd) on IL-1β- induced cartilage catabolism and the possible role of Ecd in treatment or prevention of early OA. Methods: Chondrocytes and articular cartilage was harvested from newborn ICR mice. Ecd effect on chondrocytes viability was tested and the optimal concentration was determined by MTT assay. The effect of HIF-2α (EPAS1) in cartilage catabolism simulated by IL-1β (5 ng/ml) was evaluated by articular cartilage explants culture. The effects of Ecd on IL-1β-induced inflammatory conditions and their related catabolic genes expression were analyzed. Results: Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) treatment on primary mouse articular cartilage explants enhanced their Epas1, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-3, MMP-13) and ADAMTS-5 genes expression and down-regulated collagen type II (Col2a1) gene expression. With the pre-treatment of 10-8M Ecd, the catabolic effects of IL-1β on articular cartilage were scavenged. Conclusion: In conclusions, Ecd can reduce the IL-1β-induced inflammatory effect of the cartilage. Ecd may suppress IL-1β- induced cartilage catabolism via HIF-2α pathway. ? 2015 Sheu et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",20-Hydroxyecdysone; Cartilage destruction; HIF-2α; Hypoxia; IL-1β; Normoxia,"aggrecanase 2; collagen type 2; collagenase 3; ecdysterone; hypoxia inducible factor 2alpha; interleukin 1beta; stromelysin; basic helix loop helix transcription factor; collagen type 2; collagenase 3; cytokine; ecdysterone; endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1; interleukin 1beta; stromelysin; transcription factor; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; articular cartilage; cartilage cell; cell viability; controlled study; down regulation; mouse; nonhuman; osteoarthritis; protein expression; signal transduction; tissue metabolism; animal; arthropod; articular cartilage; cartilage; cell culture; drug effects; gene expression; genetics; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; male; metabolism; osteoarthritis; synovium; Animals; Arthropods; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Cartilage; Cartilage, Articular; Cells, Cultured; Chondrocytes; Collagen Type II; Cytokines; Down-Regulation; Ecdysterone; Gene Expression; Interleukin-1beta; Male; Matrix Metalloproteinase 13; Matrix Metalloproteinase 3; Mice, Inbred ICR; Osteoarthritis; Synovial Membrane; Transcription Factors",2-s2.0-84939153458

Background: Universal symbols are an important innovative tool for health facility wayfinding systems. Hablamos Juntos, a universal healthcare symbol system developed in the United States, is a thoughtful, well-designed, and thoroughly tested symbol system that facilitates communication across languages and cultures. Methods: We designed a questionnaire to test how well the selected graphic symbols were understood by Taiwanese participants and determined factors related to successful symbol decoding, including participant-related factors, stimulation factors, and the interaction between stimulation and participants. Additionally, we further established a design principle for future development of localized healthcare symbols. Results: (1) Eleven symbols were identified as highly comprehensible and effective symbols that can be directly adopted in Taiwanese healthcare settings. Sixteen symbols were deemed incomprehensible or confusing and thus had to be redesigned. Finally, 14 were identified as relatively incomprehensible and could thus be redesigned and then have their effectiveness evaluated again. (2) Three factors were found to influence the participants’ differing levels of comprehension of the Hablamos Juntos symbols. Conclusions: In order to prevent the three aforementioned factors from causing difficulty in interpreting symbols, we suggest that the local symbol designers should (1) use more iconic images, (2) carefully evaluate the indexical and symbolic meaning of graphic symbols, and (3) collect the consensus of Taiwanese people with different educational backgrounds. ? 2016, ?

In our previous work, we developed a portable LED Induced autofluorescence (LIAF) imager contained the multiple wavelength of LED excitation light and multiple filters to capture ex-vivo oral tissue autofluorescence images. Our portable system for detection of oral cancer has a probe in front of the lens for fixing the object distance. The shape of the probe is cone, and it is not convenient for doctor to capture the oral image under an appropriate view angle in front of the probe. Therefore, a probe of L shape containing a mirror is proposed for doctors to capture the images with the right angles, and the subjects do not need to open their mouse constrainedly. Besides, a glass plate is placed in probe to prevent the liquid entering in the body, but the light reflected from the glass plate directly causes the light spots inside the images. We set the glass plate in front of LED to avoiding the light spots. When the distance between the glasses plate and the LED model plane is less than the critical value, then we can prevent the light spots caused from the glasses plate. The experiments show that the image captured with the new probe that the glasses plate placed in the back-end of the probe has no light spots inside the image. ? 2015 SPIE.",Autofluorescence; LED; light spots; oral cancer; probe,Diagnosis; Diseases; Glass; Medical applications; Probes; Radiation detectors; Radiotherapy; Autofluorescence; Cancer diagnosis; Epithelial cells; Excited fluorescence; Light spot; Multiple wavelengths; Oral cancer; Spectral distribution; Light emitting diodes,2-s2.0-84951015157

Methods: Data from 1998-2012 Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database were used for this study. ICD9-CM codes 256.4X and 648.X were used separately for the diagnoses of PCOS and GDM, which were further confirmed by records of blood tests or ultrasonography to ensure the accuracy of the diagnoses. Women diagnosed at < 15 or > 45 years of age, and those diagnosed with overt diabetes mellitus or GDM prior to PCOS were excluded. During pregnancy, each woman with a previous diagnosis of PCOS was age-matched to 10 women without PCOS. Odds ratios (ORs) for risk of GDM were calculated by logistic regression analysis with adjustment for economic status and co-morbidities. Results: Among 7,629 eligible women with a valid PCOS diagnosis, 3,109 (42.87%) had subsequent pregnancies. GDM occurred frequently among women with a history of PCOS as compared to those without PCOS (20.46% vs. 10.54%, p<0.0001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that PCOS was associated with GDM (adjusted OR = 2.15; 95% CI:1.96-2.37). Among 3,109 affected patients, 1,160 (37.31%) had used medications for PCOS and 261 (8.39%) were treated with an oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA). There was no significant difference in development of GDM between the medication and no medication sub-groups (p>0.05). If not used after conception, OHAs did not reduce the risk of GDM (adjusted OR = 1.20; 95% CI:0.88-1.62). Conclusions: A history of PCOS is a significant and independent risk factor for development of GDM. Medication for PCOS or pre-pregnancy use of OHAs does not reduce the risk of GDM. When at-risk women become pregnant, they require closer surveillance for maternal and fetal well-being, and should follow a strict diet and adhere to weight gain control to avoid obstetric complications due to GDM. ? 2015 Pan et al.",,"clomifene; cyproterone acetate; metformin; oral antidiabetic agent; antidiabetic agent; metformin; adolescent; adult; Article; controlled study; disease association; female; human; major clinical study; ovary polycystic disease; population research; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnant woman; Taiwan; comorbidity; Diabetes, Gestational; middle aged; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; pregnancy; risk factor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Comorbidity; Diabetes, Gestational; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Metformin; Middle Aged; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; Pregnancy; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84949990277

Many randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) have proved that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can reduce the risk of MACE in the people with normal or impaired kidney function without dialysis. This study seeks to clarify whether ARBs therapy could also attenuate this risk in patients with ESRD on maintenance dialysis. Materials and Methods: The National Health Research Institute provided a database of one million random subjects for the study. A random sample was taken of 1800 patients ? 18 years y/o with ESRD on dialysis without a history of MACE and use of ARBs within 6-months prior to enrollment. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors and compute the hazard ratios accompanying 95% confidence intervals. Results: In these 1800 patients, 1061 had never used ARBs, while 224 had used them for 1-90 days, and 515 had used them for more than 90 days. We found that ARBs significantly decrease the incidences of acute myocardial infarctions (AMI), coronary artery diseases (CAD) requiring coronary stent or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), peripheral artery disease (PAD) requiring percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), and acute stroke. Cumulative prescription days of ARBs beyond 365-760 days or more were found to be negatively correlated with incidence of MACEs. For patients with dual comorbidity (i.e., mellitus and hyperlipidemia), 91-365 cumulative prescription days might also attenuate the risk. Conclusions: For patients on maintenance dialysis, the use of ARBs could significantly attenuate the risk of major cardiovascular events: AMI, acute stroke, and PAD requiring PTA. ? 2015 Yang et al.",,"angiotensin receptor antagonist; candesartan; eprosartan; irbesartan; losartan; olmesartan; telmisartan; valsartan; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antihypertensive agent; acute heart infarction; adult; Article; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; coronary artery disease; coronary stent; data base; diabetes mellitus; dialysis; end stage renal disease; female; hazard ratio; hemodialysis; human; hyperlipidemia; incidence; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; male; patient selection; peripheral occlusive artery disease; peritoneal dialysis; prescription; proportional hazards model; random sample; risk reduction; transluminal coronary angioplasty; adolescent; aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; chronic kidney failure; complication; hypertension; middle aged; peritoneal dialysis; Taiwan; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Antihypertensive Agents; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Middle Aged; Peritoneal Dialysis; Taiwan; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84949809129

Although generally regarded as an organism of low virulence, S. maltophilia is an emerging multi-drug resistant opportunistic pathogen in hospital and community settings, especially among immunocompromised hosts. Risk factors associated with S. maltophilia infection include underlying malignancy, cystic fibrosis, corticosteroid or immunosuppressant therapy, the presence of an indwelling central venous catheter and exposure to broad spectrum antibiotics. In this review, we provide a synthesis of information on current global trends in S. maltophilia pathogenicity as well as updated information on the molecular mechanisms contributing to its resistance to an array of antimicrobial agents. The prevalence of S. maltophilia infection in the general population increased from 0.8-1.4% during 1997-2003 to 1.3-1.68% during 2007-2012. The most important molecular mechanisms contributing to its resistance to antibiotics include ?-lactamase production, the expression of Qnr genes, and the presence of class 1 integrons and efflux pumps. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is the antimicrobial drug of choice. Although a few studies have reported increased resistance to TMP/SMX, the majority of studies worldwide show that S. maltophilia continues to be highly susceptible. Drugs with historically good susceptibility results include ceftazidime, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and fluoroquinolones; however, a number of studies show an alarming trend in resistance to those agents. Tetracyclines such as tigecycline, minocycline, and doxycycline are also effective agents and consistently display good activity against S. maltophilia in various geographic regions and across different time periods. Combination therapies, novel agents, and aerosolized forms of antimicrobial drugs are currently being tested for their ability to treat infections caused by this multi-drug resistant organism. ? 2015 Chang, Lin, Chen and Hsueh.",Prevalence; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; Surveillance; Susceptibility; Treatment,ABC transporter; amikacin; aztreonam; beta lactam; beta lactamase; carbenicillin; ceftazidime; ciprofloxacin; clavulanic acid; colistin; cotrimoxazole; delafloxacin; doxycycline; fosfomycin; gentamicin; levofloxacin; multidrug resistance protein; polymyxin; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; rifampicin; telavancin; tetracycline derivative; ticarcillin; tigecycline; timentin; tobramycin; antibiotic sensitivity; bacterial gene; bacterial infection; clinical trial (topic); community acquired infection; disease surveillance; Gram negative bacterium; hospital infection; human; intensive care unit; mortality; multicenter study (topic); nebulization; nonhuman; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); Review; risk factor; smeABC gene; SmeDEF gene; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection,2-s2.0-84949667186

Objectives To determine the risk of CKD in patients with psoriasis and evaluate the impact of the severity of psoriasis, comorbidities and concomitant drugs on the risk of GN and CKD in patients with psoriasis. Methods We identified 4344 patients with psoriasis for the study cohort and randomly selected 13 032 subjects as a control cohort. Each subject was individually followed for up for 5 years to identify those who subsequently developed GN and CKD. Results After adjustment for traditional CKD risk factors, psoriasis was found to be independently associated with an increased risk of CKD during the follow-up period [hazard ratio (HR) 1·28; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·14-1·44]. The increased incidence of GN in patients with psoriasis (HR 1·50, 95% CI 1·24-1·81) may contribute to the positive association between psoriasis and CKD. Patients with mild and severe psoriasis had an increased risk of CKD and GN compared with the control cohort; the risk increased with severity. Patients with psoriasis and arthritis exhibited a higher risk of CKD than patients without arthritis (HR 1·62 vs. 1·26). Among drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have the strongest association with CKD in patients with psoriasis (adjusted odds ratio 1·69, 95% CI 1·14-2·49). Conclusions Psoriasis was associated with a higher risk of developing CKD and GN. High severity, psoriatic arthritis involvement and concomitant NSAIDs use further increased the risk of CKD in patients with psoriasis. What's already known about this topic? There is an increased risk of multiple comorbidities in patients with psoriasis. What does this study add? Both mild and severe psoriasis presented an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and glomerulonephritis, independent of traditional risk factors for CKD. The development of CKD in patients with psoriasis was multifaceted. High severity, psoriatic arthritis involvement and concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use further increased the risk of CKD in patients with psoriasis. ? 2014 British Association of Dermatologists.",,"azathioprine; cyclosporin A; etretin; methotrexate; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; adult; aged; arthritis; Article; chronic kidney disease; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; disease association; disease severity; female; follow up; glomerulonephritis; human; investigative procedures; major clinical study; male; middle aged; patient identification; patient selection; prevalence; priority journal; psoriasis; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; adolescent; age distribution; complication; epidemiology; glomerulonephritis; psoriasis; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; socioeconomics; Taiwan; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Epidemiologic Methods; Female; Glomerulonephritis; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psoriasis; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Socioeconomic Factors; Taiwan; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84948716264

The present study was aimed at evaluating the effects of Se yeast on oxidative stress, growth inhibition, and apoptosis in human breast cancer cells. Treatments of ER-positive MCF-7 and triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells with Se yeast (100, 750, and 1500 ng Se/mL), methylseleninic acid (MSA, 1500 ng Se/mL), or methylselenocysteine (MSC, 1500 ng Se/mL) at a time course experiment (at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h) were analyzed. Se yeast inhibited the growth of these cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Compared with the same level of MSA, cancer cells exposure to Se yeast exhibited a lower growth-inhibitory response. The latter has also lower superoxide production and reduced antioxidant enzyme activities. Furthermore, MSA (1500 ng Se/mL)-exposed non-tumorigenic human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) have a significant growth inhibitory effect, but not Se yeast and MSC. Compared with MSA, Se yeast resulted in a greater increase in the early apoptosis in MCF-7 cells as well as a lower proportion of early and late apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, nuclear morphological changes and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential were observed. In conclusion, a dose of 100 to 1500 ng Se/mL of Se yeast can increase oxidative stress, and stimulate growth inhibitory effects and apoptosis induction in breast cancer cell lines, but does not affect non-tumorigenic cells. ? 2015 Ivyspring International Publisher.",Apoptosis; Breast cancer cells; Oxidative stress; Selenium yeast,"antineoplastic agent; estrogen receptor; glutathione peroxidase; methylseleninic acid; methylselenocysteine; organoselenium derivative; reactive oxygen metabolite; selenium yeast; superoxide dismutase; unclassified drug; glutathione peroxidase; methylselenic acid; organoselenium derivative; reactive oxygen metabolite; selenium; selenocysteine; selenomethylselenocysteine; superoxide dismutase; apoptosis; Article; breast cancer; breast cancer cell line; cancer inhibition; cell nucleus; cell specificity; cell ultrastructure; concentration response; controlled study; dose time effect relation; drug selectivity; enzyme activity; human; human cell; MCF 7 cell line; MDA MB 231 cell; mitochondrial membrane potential; oxidative stress; protein expression; analogs and derivatives; apoptosis; Breast Neoplasms; cell survival; drug effects; drug screening; female; MCF-7 cell line; metabolism; oxidative stress; pathology; procedures; tumor cell line; yeast; Apoptosis; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Female; Glutathione Peroxidase; Humans; MCF-7 Cells; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Organoselenium Compounds; Oxidative Stress; Reactive Oxygen Species; Selenium; Selenocysteine; Superoxide Dismutase; Yeasts",2-s2.0-84947543842

MTT assay revealed that LPS (0.01-1 μg/mL) and lutein and zeaxanthin (1-10 μM) did not influence the cell viability of cultured UM. LPS caused a dose-dependent increase of secretion of IL-8 by cultured UM. Lutein and zeaxanthin did not affect the constitutive secretion of IL-8. However, lutein and zeaxanthin decreased LPS-induced secretion of IL-8 in cultured UM in a dose-dependent manner. LPS significantly increased NF-κB levels in cell nuclear extracts and p-JNK levels in the cell lysates from UM, but not p-p38 MAPK and p-ERG. Lutein or zeaxanthin significantly reduced LPS-induced increase of NF-κB and p-JNK levels, but not p38 MAPK and ERG levels. The present study demonstrated that lutein and zeaxanthin inhibited LPS-induced secretion of IL-8 in cultured UM via JNK and NF-κB signal pathways.

Cell fate decisions and progression toward organ and tissue maturity must be coordinated, and how an energy sensor regulates the Hh pathway is not clear. AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important sensor of energy stores and controls protein synthesis and other energy-intensive processes. AMPK is directly responsive to intracellular AMP levels, inhibiting a wide range of cell activities if ATP is low and AMP is high. Thus, AMPK can affect development by influencing protein synthesis and other processes needed for growth and differentiation. Activation of AMPK reduces GLI1 protein levels and stability, thus blocking Sonic-hedgehog-induced transcriptional activity. AMPK phosphorylates GLI1 at serines 102 and 408 and threonine 1074. Mutation of these three sites into alanine prevents phosphorylation by AMPK. This leads to increased GLI1 protein stability, transcriptional activity, and oncogenic potency. ? 2015 The Authors.",,"alanine; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; serine; sonic hedgehog protein; threonine; transcription factor Gli1; GLI1 protein, human; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; transcription factor; transcription factor Gli1; animal cell; Article; cancer inhibition; colony formation; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme regulation; gene mutation; growth inhibition; medulloblastoma; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein function; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; protein stability; real time polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; transcription termination; 3T3 cell line; amino acid sequence; animal; chemistry; HEK293 cell line; human; medulloblastoma; metabolism; molecular genetics; phosphorylation; protein processing; protein stability; tumor cell line; zebra fish; 3T3 Cells; Amino Acid Sequence; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Medulloblastoma; Mice; Molecular Sequence Data; Phosphorylation; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Protein Stability; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish; Zinc Finger Protein GLI1",2-s2.0-84947038316

How miRNA accomplishes its pleiotropic effects largely depends on its expression and its target repertoire. Previous studies discovered thousands of miRNAs and numerous miRNA target genes mainly through computation and prediction methods which produced high rates of false positive prediction. The development of Argonaute cross-linked immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-Seq) provides a system to effectively determine miRNA target genes. Likewise, the accuracy of dissecting the transcriptional regulation of miRNA genes has been greatly improved by chromatin immunoprecipitation of the transcription factors coupled with sequencing (ChIP-Seq). Elucidation of the miRNA target repertoire will provide an in-depth understanding of the functional roles of microRNA pathways. To reliably reconstruct a miRNA-mediated regulatory network, we established a computational framework using publicly available, sequence-based transcription factor-miRNA databases, including ChIPBase and TransmiR for the TF-miRNA interactions, along with miRNA-target databases, including miRTarBase, TarBase and starBase, for the miRNA-target interactions. We applied the computational framework to elucidate the miRNA-mediated regulatory network in the Mir122a-/-mouse model, which has an altered transcriptome and progressive liver disease.Results: We applied our computational framework to the expression profiles of miRNA/mRNA of Mir122a-/-mutant mice and wild-type mice. The miRNA-mediated network involves 40 curated TFs contributing to the aberrant expression of 65 miRNAs and 723 curated miRNA target genes, of which 56% was found in the differentially-expressed genes of Mir122a--mice. Hence, the regulatory network disclosed previously-known and also many previously-unidentified miRNA-mediated regulations in mutant mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that loss of imprinting at the chromosome 12qF1 region is associated with miRNA overexpression in human hepatocellular carcinoma and stem cells, suggesting initiation of precancerous changes in young mice deficient in miR-122. A group of 9 miRNAs was found to share miR-122 target genes, indicating synergy between miRNAs and target genes by way of multiplicity and cooperativity.Conclusions: The study provides significant insight into miRNA-mediated regulatory networks. Based on experimentally verified data, this network is highly reliable and effective in revealing previously-undetermined disease-associated molecular mechanisms. This computational framework can be applied to explore the significant TF-miRNA-miRNA target interactions in any complex biological systems with high degrees of confidence. ? 2015 Hsu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"microRNA 122; microRNA 122a; transcriptome; unclassified drug; microRNA; Mirn122 microRNA, mouse; transcription factor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; chromosome 12q; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; disease association; disease course; gene expression regulation; high throughput sequencing; liver cell carcinoma; male; mathematical analysis; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; protein interaction; regulatory mechanism; reliability; RNA analysis; wild type; animal; biological model; biology; chromatin immunoprecipitation; gene expression profiling; gene regulatory network; genetic database; genetics; high throughput screening; human; knockout mouse; liver; liver tumor; metabolism; procedures; reproducibility; signal transduction; Animals; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Regulatory Networks; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Humans; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Mice, Knockout; MicroRNAs; Models, Genetic; Reproducibility of Results; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors",2-s2.0-84945944459

DDX3 is a wellknown host cofactor of HCV replication. In this study, we investigated the role of a DDX3-interacting protein, Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1), in the HCV life cycle. Both YB-1 and DDX3 interacted with the viral nonstructural protein NS5A. During HCV infection, YB-1 partially colocalized with NS5A and the HCV replication intermediate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in HCVinfected Huh-7.5.1 cells. Despite sharing the same interacting partners, YB-1 participated in HCV RNA replication but was dispensable in steady-state HCV RNA replication, different from the action of DDX3. Moreover, knockdown of YB-1 in HCV-infected cells prevented infectious virus production and reduced the ratio of hyperphosphorylated (p58) to hypophosphorylated (p56) forms of NS5A, whereas DDX3 silencing did not affect the ratio of the p58 and p56 phosphoforms of NS5A. Interestingly, silencing of YB-1 severely reduced NS5A protein stability in NS5A-ectopically expressing, replicon-containing, and HCV-infected cells. Furthermore, mutations of serine 102 of YB-1 affected both YB-1-NS5A interaction and NS5A-stabilizing activity of YB-1, indicating that this Akt phosphorylation site of YB-1 plays an important role in stabilizing NS5A. Collectively, our results support a model in which the event of YB-1 phosphorylation-mediated interaction with NS5A results in stabilizing NS5A to sustain HCV RNA replication and infectious HCV production. Overall, our study may reveal a new aspect for the development of novel anti-HCV drugs. ? 2015, American Society for Microbiology.",,"DDX3 protein; double stranded RNA; nonstructural protein 5A; protein kinase B; protein p56; protein p58; serine; unclassified drug; virus RNA; Y box binding protein 1; DDX3X protein, human; DEAD box protein; NS-5 protein, hepatitis C virus; small interfering RNA; viral protein; Y box binding protein 1; YBX1 protein, human; Article; cell line; controlled study; enzyme phosphorylation; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus; Huh 7.5.1 cell; life cycle; mutation; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; protein RNA binding; protein stability; regulatory mechanism; RNA replication; steady state; transcription regulation; virus replication; biosynthesis; genetics; Hepacivirus; human; metabolism; phosphorylation; physiology; protein stability; RNA interference; tumor cell line; virus replication; Cell Line, Tumor; DEAD-box RNA Helicases; Hepacivirus; Humans; Phosphorylation; Protein Stability; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering; RNA, Viral; Viral Nonstructural Proteins; Virus Replication; Y-Box-Binding Protein 1",2-s2.0-84945919954

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether combined treatment with the autophagy inhibitor: hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and the autophagy inducer: sirolimus (rapamycin, Rapa) would reduce glucose utilization in sarcoma patients. Methods: Ten sarcoma patients who failed first-line treatment were enrolled in this study. They were treated with 1 mg of Rapa and 200 mg of HCQ twice daily for two weeks. The standardized uptake values (SUV) from pretreatment and posttreatment [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) scans were reviewed, and changes from the baseline SUVmax were evaluated. Results: Based on FDG PET response criteria, six patients had a partial response; three had stable disease, and one had progressive disease. Nevertheless, none of them showed a reduction in tumor volume. The mean SUVmax reduction in the 34 lesions evaluated was - 19.6% (95% CI = -30.1% to -9.1%), while the mean volume change was +16.4% (95% CI = +5.8% to + 27%). Only grade 1 toxicities were observed. Elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase were detected after treatment in most metabolic responders. Conclusions: The results of reduced SUVmax without tumor volume reduction after two weeks of Rapa and HCQ treatment may indicate that non-proliferative glycolysis occurred mainly in the cancer associated fibroblast compartment, and decreased glycolytic activity was evident from Rapa + HCQ double autophagy modulator treatment.",Hydroxychloroquine; Sirolimus; Soft tissue sarcoma,"deoxyglucose; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; hydroxychloroquine; lactate dehydrogenase; rapamycin; antineoplastic agent; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; glucose blood level; hydroxychloroquine; rapamycin; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; asthenia; autophagy; cancer associated fibroblast; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer growth; cancer patient; clinical article; clinical trial; constipation; diarrhea; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug response; drug safety; drug tolerability; dyspnea; female; fever; fibroblast; glucose metabolism; glucose transport; glucose utilization; glycolysis; hair loss; human; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; male; mucosa inflammation; nausea; positron emission tomography; rash; sarcoma; sarcoma cell; somnolence; tumor volume; autophagy; chemically induced; drug administration; drug effects; glucose blood level; metabolism; middle aged; nausea; pathology; phase 2 clinical trial; procedures; rash; sarcoma; treatment outcome; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Autophagy; Blood Glucose; Drug Administration Schedule; Exanthema; Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Male; Middle Aged; Nausea; Positron-Emission Tomography; Sarcoma; Sirolimus; Treatment Outcome; Tumor Burden; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84945157574

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease, particularly RNA splicing, have remained underexplored. Here, we report a triple-level (gene-, transcript-, and exon-level) analysis of lung adenocarcinoma transcriptomes from 77 paired tumor and normal tissues, as well as an analysis pipeline to overcome genetic variability for accurate differentiation between tumor and normal tissues. We report three major results. First, more than 5,000 differentially expressed transcripts/exonic regions occur repeatedly in lung adenocarcinoma patients. These transcripts/exonic regions are enriched in nicotine metabolism and ribosomal functions in addition to the pathways enriched for differentially expressed genes (cell cycle, extracellular matrix receptor interaction, and axon guidance). Second, classification models based on rationally selected transcripts or exonic regions can reach accuracies of 0.93 to 1.00 in differentiating tumor from normal tissues. Of the 28 selected exonic regions, 26 regions correspond to alternative exons located in such regulators as tumor suppressor (GDF10), signal receptor (LYVE1), vascular-specific regulator (RASIP1), ubiquitination mediator (RNF5), and transcriptional repressor (TRIM27). Third, classification systems based on 13 to 14 differentially expressed genes yield accuracies near 100%. Genes selected by both detection methods include C16orf59, DAP3, ETV4, GABARAPL1, PPAR, RADIL, RSPO1, SERTM1, SRPK1, ST6GALNAC6, and TNXB. Our findings imply a multilayered lung adenocarcinoma regulome in which transcript-/exon-level regulation may be dissociated from gene-level regulation.

An alternative approach involving liquid crystals (LCs) was proposed, based on the fact that an immunocomplex can disturb the orientation of LCs, leading to an optical texture different from the case when only antigen or antibody exists. This method is label-free, easy to manipulate and lowcost. However, its sensitivity was low for practical usage. In this study, we adopted a high-birefringence liquid crystal (LC) to enhance the sensitivity for the immunodetection. Experiments were performed, targeting at the cancer biomarker CA125. We showed that the larger birefringence (Δn = 0.33 at 20 °C) amplifies the detected signal and, in turn, dramatically improves the detection limit. To avoid signal loss from conventional rinsing steps in immunodetection, CA125 antigen and antibody were reacted before immobilized on substrates. We studied the specific binding events and obtained a detection limit as low as 1 ng/ml. The valid temperature ranges were compared by using the typical single-compound LC 5CB and the high-birefringence LC mixture.

To reduce deployment cost, the distance between two RSUs could be long; that is, the communications between an RSU and a vehicle may be carried out through multi-hops among intermediate vehicles. When a vehicle is driven from one RSU to another, the wireless multi-hop delay becomes more serious as the number of multi-hop relays increases. The wireless multi-hop delay is critical for some emergency service. For instance, in a traffic accident, when a patient was sent to the hospital by ambulance, the life information of the patient must be transmitted to the hospital on time through the multi-hop wireless network. If the ambulance is moved from one RSU to another, the wireless multi-hop delay becomes more and more serious as the ambulance is closing to another RSU. In this paper, we propose an RSU re-routing strategy that dynamically alters multi-hop communications until the best RSU with the shortest path using location information is found. Moreover, we compare the proposed strategy with the existing strategy in terms of broadcasting costs, re-routing delay, and wireless multi-hop delay of data transmission.

However, the protective association model between the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Orai1 gene was not investigated. Based on a published data set of 345 female breast cancer patients and 290 female controls, we used a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to identify the possible protective models of breast cancer association in terms of the SNPs of Orai1 gene. Results showed that the PSO-generated models of 2-SNP (rs12320939-TT/rs12313273-CC), 3-SNP (rs12320939-TT/rs12313273-CC/rs712853-(TT/TC)), 4-SNP (rs12320939-TT/rs12313273-CC/rs7135617-(GG/GT)/rs712853-(TT/TC)), and 5-SNP (rs12320939-TT/rs12313273-CC/rs7135617-(GG/GT)/rs6486795-CC/rs712853-(TT/TC)) displayed low values of odds ratios (0.409-0.425) for breast cancer association. Taken together, these results suggested that our proposed PSO strategy is powerful to identify the combinational SNPs of rs12320939, rs12313273, rs7135617, rs6486795, and rs712853 of Orai1 gene with a strongly protective association in breast cancer. ? 2015 Fu Ou-Yang et al.",,"calcium release activated calcium channel 1; calcium channel; calcium release activated calcium channel 1; ORAI1 protein, human; allele; Article; breast cancer; cancer patient; cancer prevention; cancer risk; controlled study; female; gene frequency; genetic algorithm; genetic association; genetic risk; genotype; human; major clinical study; particle swarm optimization; process optimization; single nucleotide polymorphism; Taiwanese; algorithm; biology; Breast Neoplasms; case control study; genetic database; genetic predisposition; genetics; procedures; risk; single nucleotide polymorphism; Taiwan; Algorithms; Breast Neoplasms; Calcium Channels; Case-Control Studies; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; ORAI1 Protein; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk; Taiwan",2-s2.0-84941050807

The embedded relay lens microscopic hyperspectral imaging system (ERL-MHIS) provides a morphological image of a biopsy sample and the spectrum of each pixel in the image simultaneously. Based on the ERL-MHIS, this work develops morphological and spectral methods to diagnose oral carcinoma biopsy. In morphological discrimination, the fractal dimension method is applied to differentiate between normal and abnormal tissues. In spectral identification, normal and cancerous cells are distinguished using five methods. However, the spectra of normal and cancerous cells vary with patient. The diagnostic performances of the five methods are thus not ideal. Hence, the proposed cocktail approach is used to determine the effectiveness of the spectral methods in correlating with the sampling conditions. And then we use a combination of effective spectral methods according to the sample conditions for diagnosing a sample. A total of 68 biopsies from 34 patients are analyzed using the ERL-MHIS. The results demonstrate a sensitivity of 90 ± 4.53% and a specificity of 87.8 ± 5.21%. Furthermore, in our survey, this system is the first time utilized to study oral carcinoma biopsies. ?

This study was conducted to analyze the perioperative variables and postoperative outcomes among heart transplant recipients with extremely high lactate levels (>15 mmol/L). Methods The single-center medical records of heart transplantation from June 2006 to May 2013 were retrospectively reviewed for patient characteristics, perioperative hemodynamic variables, arterial blood gas analysis data, and postoperative mortality. Results Among 58 consecutive heart transplant recipients, lactate levels over the detectable upper limit (>15 mmol/L) were identified in 12 patients after intensive care unit admission, with peak time at 1.9 ± 2.0 (range 0-6.1) hours. The maximal preoperative lactate level was 3.1 mmol/L, and most (11/12) postoperative lactate levels returned to <4 mmol/L at 27.5 ± 12.8 hours after surgery (range 15-58, median 24), displaying a trend toward delayed extubation time in 10 recipients (P <.01). Blood glucose levels elevated significantly from preoperative 148.9 ± 45.2 to 375.7 ± 96.9 mg/dL at peak lactate level (P <.01). Four patients died in the ICU (range 5-32 days), 4 died after discharge (range 5-57 months), with 6 in total surviving over 1 year. Conclusion Extreme hyperlactatemia commonly occurred early after heart transplantation and mostly recovered within 30 hours; however, with delayed extubation time after operation. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc.",,glucose; lactic acid; lactic acid; adult; arterial gas; Article; blood gas analysis; extubation; female; glucose blood level; graft recipient; heart graft; heart transplantation; hemodynamics; hospital admission; hospital discharge; human; hyperlactatemia; intensive care unit; major clinical study; male; medical record review; perioperative period; postoperative period; priority journal; surgical mortality; adverse effects; aged; blood; heart transplantation; hyperlactatemia; middle aged; mortality; postoperative complication; prognosis; retrospective study; statistics and numerical data; survival; Adult; Aged; Blood Gas Analysis; Female; Heart Transplantation; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Hyperlactatemia; Intensive Care Units; Lactic Acid; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis,2-s2.0-84939459317

MUTYH glycosylase involved in DNA repair pathways may be associated with the risk of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Therefore, the association between polymorphisms in the MUTYH gene and RA was evaluated. Methods. We recruited 192 RA patients and 192 healthy subjects in Taiwan. The 4 MUTYH polymorphisms (rs3219463, rs3219476, rs3219489, and rs3219493) were detected and haplotype analysis was performed using the Bayesian method. The genotype and allelic frequency distributions of the polymorphisms in both RA patients and healthy patients were compared by the chi-square test. Results. Comparison of the genotype/allele frequencies between individuals with RA and the control groups revealed significant differences in 2 MUTYH gene polymorphisms, rs3219463 and rs3219476. After we performed a haplotype-specific analysis, the haplotypes Ht6-GTGC and Ht8-GGCG had lower presenting rates in RA patients than in the control groups. Furthermore, the genotype frequency of rs3219463 G/ was significantly increased among patients with immunoglobulin M rheumatoid factors, whereas that of rs3219476 was not. Conclusion. We demonstrated that the rs3219463 and rs3219476 polymorphisms in RA patients from a Taiwan Chinese population were associated with disease susceptibility. These data indicate that the MUTYH gene may play a role in the progression of RA. ? 2015 Yung-Jen Kung et al.",,"DNA glycosylase MutY; immunoglobulin M; rheumatoid factor; DNA glycosylase MutY; DNA glycosyltransferase; genetic marker; adult; Article; Chinese; clinical feature; controlled study; female; gene frequency; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic risk; genotype; haplotype; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; rheumatoid arthritis; single nucleotide polymorphism; Taiwan; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; genetic marker; genetic predisposition; genetics; incidence; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; reproducibility; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; single nucleotide polymorphism; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Base Sequence; DNA Glycosylases; Female; Genetic Markers; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Haplotypes; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Molecular Sequence Data; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors; Sensitivity and Specificity; Taiwan",2-s2.0-84939213001

Design: Prospective cohort study (Canadian Task Force classification: II-2). Setting: University teaching hospital. Patients: One hundred seventy-eight patients with benign 5- to 15-cm cystic ovarian tumors who underwent LESS with OSAS (suspension group, n = 90) and without OSAS (control group, n = 88). Interventions: For patients who underwent OSAS (suspension group), 1 end of double-head straight needles with a polypropylene suture was inserted into the pelvic cavity through the abdominal skin to penetrate the cyst or ovarian parenchyma and puncture outside the abdominal skin. After cutting off the needles, both sides of the remaining suture were held together by a clamp, without knotting, so that the manipulator could ""lift,"" ""loosen,"" or ""fix"" the stitches to adjust the tension. Measurements and Main Results: The average time to create OSAS was 2.9 min. For the suspension and control groups, the average blood loss was 81.4 and 131.8 mL (p < .001), and the operative time was 42.0 and 61.3 min (p < .001), respectively. There were no significant differences in the incidence of complications (5.6% vs 9.1%; p =.365), but there were significant differences in conversions to standard non-single-site laparoscopy (5.6% vs 15.9%; p=.025) and laparotomy (1.1% vs 6.8%; p =.040). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the ratios of conversion to standard non-single-site laparoscopy (odds ratio [OR], 0.126; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.311-0.508) and laparotomy (OR, 0.032; 95% CI, 0.002-0.479) were much lower in the suspension group; the risk of complications was comparable (OR, 0.346; 95% CI, 0.085-1.403). Conclusion: OSAS is an easy, safe, and feasible method that offers advantages during LESS. Although routine use of OSAS is not necessary, OSAS can be considered during LESS to facilitate the surgery. ? 2015 AAGL.",Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery; LESS; OSAS; Ovarian suspension with adjustable sutures; SILS; Single incision laparoscopic surgery,adult; Article; cancer patient; cancer surgery; clamp; cohort analysis; comparative effectiveness; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; digestive system injury; feasibility study; female; fever; gynecologic surgery; human; incidence; laparoendoscopic single site surgery; laparotomy; major clinical study; minimally invasive surgery; needle; operation duration; operative blood loss; ovarian suspension with adjustable suture; ovary cyst; ovary tumor; patient safety; pelvis; polypropylene suture; postoperative ileus; prospective study; skin penetration; surgical infection; surgical patient; teaching hospital; university hospital; urogenital tract injury; uterine manipulator; gynecologic surgery; laparoscopy; male; middle aged; Ovarian Neoplasms; procedures; suture; Taiwan; Tissue Adhesions; Adult; Female; Gynecologic Surgical Procedures; Humans; Laparoscopy; Laparotomy; Male; Middle Aged; Operative Time; Ovarian Neoplasms; Prospective Studies; Sutures; Taiwan; Tissue Adhesions,2-s2.0-84938504042

To date, no zebrafish animal model has demonstrated the characteristic manifestations of ALD in the setting of chronic alcohol exposure. The aim of this study was to develop a zebrafish animal model for ALD. Male adult zebrafish were housed in a 1% (v/v) ethanol solution up to 3 months. A histopathological study showed the characteristic features of alcoholic liver steatosis and steatohepatitis in the early stages of alcohol exposure, including fat droplet accumulation, ballooning degeneration of the hepatocytes, and Mallory body formation. As the exposure time increased, collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix was observed by Sirius red staining and immunofluorescence staining. Finally, anaplastic hepatocytes with pleomorphic nuclei were arranged in trabecular patterns and formed nodules in the zebrafish liver. Over the time course of 1% ethanol exposure, upregulations of lipogenesis, fibrosis, and tumor-related genes were also revealed by semiquantitative and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. As these data reflect characteristic liver damage by alcohol in humans, this zebrafish animal model may serve as a powerful tool to study the pathogenesis and treatment of ALD and its related disorders in humans. ?

Especially in Asia, AB becomes a friendly practice in traditional medicine, for instance, a gentle spiritual exercise of Tai Chi Chuan , a combination of breathing exercise, relaxation and meditation of Chi Kung , and different yoga-type breathing patterns. Most of experienced mentors advise learners memorizing AB step by step. However, it is hard to retrieve for learners to practice AB by themselves. Within this paper, we present an iso-volume maneuver (IVM) tutoring system based on learning by doing for subjects to learn AB. During the IVM, subjects focus on the abdominal wall movement, and remember the AB pattern by observing respiratory signals in this system. The IVM tutoring system also measures the respiratory signals by respiratory inductive plethysmography and calculates the energy proportion of abdominal wall movement signals (Eawm) to evaluate the performance of AB learning. The higher Eawm represents the more correct practicing AB. A 50 subjects’ experiment which divided subjects into IVM and non-IVM groups (learning AB with step by step instructions) is introduced in this study. Results indicate that IVM group has significant higher Eawm (59.5±6.0%) than the non-IVM group (51.6±10.4%). Therefore, the IVM group performs better AB than the non-IVM group. We conclude that the IVM tutoring system is efficient for individual to learn AB. ?

Bioceramic also facilitates the breakup of large clusters of water molecules by weakening hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bond weakening, which allows water molecules to act in diverse ways under different conditions, is one of the key mechanisms underlying the effects of Bioceramic on biophysical and physical-chemical processes. Herein, we used sound to amplify the effect of Bioceramic and further developed an experimental device for use in humans. Thirteen patients who suffered from various chronic and acute illnesses that severely affected their sleep patterns and life quality were enrolled in a trial of Bioceramic resonance (i.e., rhythmic 100-dB sound waves with frequency set at 10 Hz) applied to the skin surface of the anterior chest. According to preliminary data, a ""Propagated Sensation along Meridians"" (PSM) was experienced in all Bioceramic resonance-treated patients but not in any of the nine control patients. The device was believed to enhance microcirculation through a series of biomolecular and physiological processes and to subject the specific meridian channels of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) to coherent vibration.

The purpose of this study was to determine if subclinical markers of atherosclerosis are associated with a decline in olfactory function. Methods. The San Diego Odor Identification Test was administered to 2,302 participants (age 21-84 years) at the baseline (2005-2008) and 5-year follow-up (2010-2013) examinations of the Beaver Dam Offspring Study. A decline in odor identification was defined as a decrease in San Diego Odor Identification Test score of 2 or more (range 0-8) from Beaver Dam Offspring Study 1 to Beaver Dam Offspring Study 2. Carotid intima media thickness and plaque, blood pressure, pulse wave velocity, and body mass index were measured and other risk factor data were obtained by interview. Results. Overall 3.2% of participants had a decline in San Diego Odor Identification Test score at 5 years. In age- and sex-adjusted models, mean intima media thickness (odds ratio = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.34, per 0.1 mm) and number of sites (range 0-6) with carotid artery plaque (odds ratio = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.11, 1.65, per site) at baseline were associated with an increased risk for decline. Plaque score (odds ratio = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.53) remained a significant independent predictor of olfactory decline in a model that included age, sex, hypertension, body mass index, alcohol, and smoking. Conclusions. Subclinical atherosclerosis was associated with an increased risk for olfactory decline indicating that atherosclerosis may be one of the risk factors for the decline in olfactory function seen with aging.

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the course of incident delirium and SSD, their risk factors, and impact on patients' cognitive function after elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Methods: Consecutive patients scheduled for an isolated CABG at a tertiary medical center in Taiwan were enrolled if they had no preoperative delirium symptoms. Delirium was assessed daily for 1 week after surgery using the Confusion Assessment Method. Subsyndromal delirium was defined as presenting with any core symptom below the diagnostic threshold for delirium. Cognitive function was assessed by the Mini-mental State Examination. Results: Of 38 participants, 7 had incident (first-time) delirium (18.4% incidence) and 13 had incident SSD (34.2% incidence). Whereas SSD usually lasted 1 day, delirium changed gradually to SSD to recovery and its symptomatology lasted longer. We identified 6 delirium risk factors: older age, more comorbidities, cardiac pulmonary bypass, blood transfusion, larger transfusion volume, and longer duration of intraoperative blood pressure less than 60 mm Hg. The frequencies of these risk factors for SSD were often intermediate between those of risk factors in groups with and without delirium. By hospital discharge, participants with delirium had the longest hospital stays and lowest cognitive scores, those with SSD had intermediate stays and scores, and those without delirium had the lowest stays and scores. Conclusion: Delirium and SSD after CABG are common. Greater number and severity of risk factors for delirium may predict increasingly poor outcomes, with the dose-response relationship between risk factors and outcomes for SSD intermediate between that for no symptoms and full delirium. Intervention trials are indicated, particularly for patients with a greater number and severity of predisposing and precipitating risk factors. Copyright ? 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Routinely applying SILC is debatable. Methods Two hundred SILCs were performed with single-incision multiple-port longitudinal-array and self-camera techniques. Results Eighty-eight (44%) procedures were scheduled for complicated diseases. The routine group had a higher comorbidity rate, a lower preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography rate, a higher intraoperative cholangiography rate, a higher proportion of complicated gallbladder diseases, shorter operative time, more intraoperative blood loss, and lower postoperative pethidine dose than the selective group (the first 73 patients). The conversion and complication rates showed no statistical difference. It took fewer cases but longer time to pass the learning phase of SILC for complicated gallbladder diseases. The multivariate analysis showed that male sex and complicated gallbladder diseases were associated with a higher procedure conversion rate, and increased patient age was related to a higher complication rate. Conclusions Routine SILC for benign gallbladder diseases is feasible in the experienced phase. Practicing SILC for uncomplicated gallbladder diseases helps to achieve competence in this technique for complicated diseases. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Long-term cultures of primary bone cells exhibit phenotypic and functional degeneration; therefore, culturing cells or tissues suitable for clinical use remain a challenge. A platform consisting of human osteoblasts (hOBs), calcium-alginate (Ca-Alginate) scaffolds, and a self-made bioreactor system was established for autologous transplantation of human osteoblast cell clusters. The Ca-Alginate scaffold facilitated the growth and differentiation of human bone cell clusters, and the functionally-closed process bioreactor system supplied the soluble nutrients and osteogenic signals required to maintain the cell viability. This system preserved the proliferative ability of cells and cell viability and up-regulated bone-related gene expression and biological apatite crystals formation. The bone-like tissue generated could be extracted by removal of calcium ions via ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) chelation, and exhibited a size suitable for injection. The described strategy could be used in therapeutic application and opens new avenues for surgical interventions to correct skeletal defects. ? 2015 Ivyspring International Publisher.",Autografts; Bone-like tissues; Perfusion; Preformed scaffolds; Three-dimensional culture,"alkaline phosphatase; beta 2 microglobulin; calcium alginate; collagen type 1; edetic acid; messenger RNA; osteocalcin; transcription factor RUNX2; alginic acid; glucuronic acid; hexuronic acid; Alp1 gene; Article; autotransplantation; B2M gene; Bglap gene; bioreactor; bone density; bone development; bone mass; cell proliferation; cell transplantation; cell viability; chelation; Col1a1 gene; controlled study; crystallization; culture technique; gene expression regulation; human; human cell; osteoblast; porosity; process development; Runx2 gene; scanning electron microscopy; three dimensional cell culture system; three dimensional imaging; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; cell culture; chemistry; cytology; devices; drug effects; osteoblast; physiology; procedures; tissue scaffold; Alginates; Bioreactors; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Glucuronic Acid; Hexuronic Acids; Humans; Osteoblasts; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds",2-s2.0-84930622801

Methods: This was a prospective, randomized, open-label study. Acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (. n=67) were randomized to receive 10mg IM olanzapine (. n=37) or 5mg IM haloperidol plus 2mg IM lorazepam (. n=30). Agitation was measured with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Excited Component (PANSS-EC) and Agitation-Calmness Evaluation Scale (ACES) during the first 2 hours and at 24 hours after the first injection. Safety was assessed using the Simpson-Angus Scale and Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale and by recording adverse events at 24 hours following the first injection. The Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale was also rated. Results: The PANSS-EC scores decreased significantly at 2 hours after the first injection in both groups (olanzapine: -10.2, p<0.001; haloperidol+lorazepam: -9.9, p<0.001). Haloperidol plus lorazepam was not inferior to olanzapine in reducing agitation at 2 hours. There were no significant differences in PANSS-EC or ACES scores between the two groups within 2 hours following the first injection. The frequencies of adverse events and changes in Clinical Global Impression-Severity, Simpson-Angus Scale, and Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale scores from baseline to 24 hours showed no significant differences between the groups. Conclusion: The findings suggest that IM haloperidol (5mg) plus lorazepam (2mg) is not inferior to IM olanzapine (10mg) in the treatment of acute schizophrenic patients with moderate to severe agitation (.

Respondents' opinions about HPSSN and the relationship between these perceptions and HPS implementation were examined. METHODS: In 2011, 800 primary and middle schools were selected through stratified random sampling. School staff members (N = 656) in charge of HPS programs reported their impressions of the HPSSN's support. RESULTS: Respondents were most satisfied with consultants and schools' recognition of responsibilities and rules and their interactions with HPSSN administrators. They were least satisfied with the extent of their HPSSN consultant interaction and believed HPSSN provided insufficient resources to establish HPS. Respondents' consultant partnerships and satisfaction with HPSSN administration significantly predicted HPS implementation. Additionally, the predictive values of healthy policies and school-community relationships were greater than the other 6 HPS components. CONCLUSIONS: HPSSN positively influenced HPS implementation; however, consultant/school partnerships and school resource allocations must be improved. ? 2015, American School Health Association.",Consultant/school partnership; Health-promoting school; Program evaluation,adolescent; adult; child; consultation; female; health care policy; human; male; middle aged; organization and management; program evaluation; public relations; school health service; Taiwan; university; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Consultants; Faculty; Female; Health Policy; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Male; Middle Aged; Program Evaluation; School Health Services; Taiwan,2-s2.0-84930154674

Here, we postulated that oxidative stress induces sterol regulatory element - binding protein 2 (SREBP2) and microRNA-92a (miR-92a), which in turn activate endothelial innate immune response, leading to dysfunctional endothelium. Methods and Results - Using cultured endothelial cells challenged by diverse oxidative stresses, hypercholesterolemic zebrafish, and angiotensin II - infused or aged mice, we demonstrated that SREBP2 transactivation of microRNA-92a (miR-92a) is oxidative stress inducible. The SREBP2-induced miR-92a targets key molecules in endothelial homeostasis, including sirtuin 1, Kr?ppel-like factor 2, and Kr?ppel-like factor 4, leading to NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 inflammasome activation and endothelial nitric oxide synthase inhibition. In endothelial cell - specific SREBP2 transgenic mice, locked nucleic acid - modified antisense miR-92a attenuates inflammasome, improves vasodilation, and ameliorates angiotensin II - induced and aging-related atherogenesis. In patients with coronary artery disease, the level of circulating miR-92a is inversely correlated with endothelial cell - dependent, flow-mediated vasodilation and is positively correlated with serum level of interleukin-1β. Conclusions - Our findings suggest that SREBP2 - miR-92a - inflammasome exacerbates endothelial dysfunction during oxidative stress. Identification of this mechanism may help in the diagnosis or treatment of disorders associated with oxidative stress, innate immune activation, and endothelial dysfunction. ? 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.",Endothelium; Inflammasomes; MicroRNA-92; Oxidative stress; Sterol regulatory element binding protein 2,"angiotensin II; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; kruppel like factor 2; kruppel like factor 4; microRNA; microRNA 92a; nucleotide binding oligomerization domain like receptor; sirtuin 1; sterol regulatory element binding protein 2; unclassified drug; angiotensin II; EUK-134; hybrid protein; hydrogen peroxide; inflammasome; interleukin 1beta; low density lipoprotein; microRNA; MIRN92 microRNA, human; Mirn92 microRNA, mouse; MIRN92 microRNA, zebrafish; organometallic compound; oxidized low density lipoprotein; salicylic acid derivative; scavenger; sterol regulatory element binding protein 2; zebrafish protein; aged; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; atherogenesis; controlled study; endothelium cell; enzyme inhibition; female; human; human cell; hypercholesterolemia; in vitro study; in vivo study; innate immunity; male; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; transactivation; zebra fish; animal; biosynthesis; blood; coronary artery disease; endothelium cell; gene expression regulation; genetics; HEK293 cell line; immunology; innate immunity; metabolism; middle aged; oxidative stress; pathophysiology; physiology; reporter gene; transcription initiation; transgenic mouse; umbilical vein endothelial cell; vascular endothelium; Aged; Angiotensin II; Animals; Coronary Disease; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium, Vascular; Female; Free Radical Scavengers; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, Reporter; HEK293 Cells; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Hypercholesterolemia; Immunity, Innate; Inflammasomes; Interleukin-1beta; Lipoproteins, LDL; Male; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; Organometallic Compounds; Oxidative Stress; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Salicylates; Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 2; Transcriptional Activation; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins",2-s2.0-84929514981

EEG and solution latencies (SLs) were recorded as 11 neurologically healthy volunteers worked on intellectually challenging math puzzles that involved combining four single-digit numbers through basic arithmetic operators (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication) to create an arithmetic expression equaling 24. Estimates of EEG spectral power were computed in three frequency bands-θ (4-7 Hz), α (8-13 Hz) and β (14-30 Hz)-over a widely distributed montage of scalp electrode sites. The magnitude of power estimates was found to change in a linear fashion with SLs-that is, relative to a base of power spectrum, theta power increased with longer SLs, while alpha and beta power tended to decrease. Further, the topographic distribution of spectral fluctuations was characterized by more pronounced asymmetries along the left-right and anterior-posterior axes for solutions that involved a longer search phase. These findings reveal for the first time the topography and dynamics of EEG spectral activities important for sustained solution search during arithmetical problem solving. ? 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.",electroencephalogram (EEG); Mathematical problem solving; solution latencies (SLs),Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Estimation; Frequency bands; Anterior posteriors; Arithmetic expression; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Healthy volunteers; Mathematical problem solving; Solution searches; Spectral activity; Spectral fluctuations; Problem solving; adult; brain; brain mapping; electroencephalography; female; human; male; mathematics; physiology; procedures; Adult; Brain; Brain Mapping; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Male; Mathematics,2-s2.0-84928409153

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may be an alternative option for the treatment of AHF. In this study, we reprogrammed human dental pulp-derived fibroblasts into iPSCs, which exhibited pluripotency and the capacity to differentiate into tridermal lineages, including hepatocyte-like cells (iPSC-Heps). These iPSC-Heps resembled human embryonic stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells in gene signature and hepatic markers/functions. To improve iPSC-Heps engraftment, we next developed an injectable carboxymethyl-hexanoyl chitosan hydrogel (CHC) with sustained hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) release (HGF–CHC) and investigated the hepatoprotective activity of HGF–CHCdelivered iPSC-Heps in vitro and in an immunocompromised AHF mouse model induced by thioacetamide (TAA). Intrahepatic delivery of HGF–CHC–iPSC-Heps reduced the TAA-induced hepatic necrotic area and rescued liver function and recipient viability. Compared with PBS-delivered iPSC-Heps, the HGF–CHC-delivered iPSC-Heps exhibited higher antioxidant and antiapoptotic activities that reduced hepatic necrotic area. Importantly, these HGF–CHC-mediated responses could be abolished by administering anti-HGF neutralizing antibodies. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that HGF mediated the enhancement of iPSC-Hep antioxidant/antiapoptotic capacities and hepatoprotection and that HGF–CHC is as an excellent vehicle for iPSC-Hep engraftment in iPSC-based therapy against AHF. ? 2015 Cognizant Comm.

Methods: Retrospective case series study. The medical records of patients receiving intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents for Stage 4 retinopathy of prematurity from January 2007 to May 2012 in Taipei Veterans General Hospital were reviewed. Results: A total of 13 eyes of 7 patients (3 boys and 4 girls) with Stage 4 retinopathy of prematurity were included. The mean gestational age and birth weight were 27.6 ± 2.6 weeks (range, 24.5-30.5 weeks) and 893.1 ± 293.2 g (range, 550-1422 g), respectively. The mean age at the time of injection was 38.2 ± 1.9 weeks (range, 36.0-41.5 weeks) postmenstrual age, and the mean follow-up period was 37.8 ± 19.5 months (range, 11.0-67.5 months). The active neovascularization regressed rapidly, and the anatomical outcomes were favorable in all patients. One eye developed recurrent retinal hemorrhage with localized retinal detachment 21 weeks after initial treatment, which resolved after a second injection. There were no ocular or systemic complications in these patients. Conclusion: Intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents may be effective as monotherapy or as supplement to failed laser treatment for patients with Stage 4 retinopathy of prematurity without additional surgical intervention.

In the proposed SFP LPFIR (linear-phase finite impulse response) filter engine, lower silicon area and lesser power consumption facilitate better SNR performance than that achieved with the conventional post-truncation (PT) datapath with integer arithmetic. Moreover, in the proposed LPFIR filter engine, a cascaded 16-bit SFP A-M-S-Acc datapath is used that consists of two embedded 1-bit shifters to improve hardware usage and parallelism, one 16-bit DT adder (A), one 16-bit DT multiplier (M), one 16-bit barrel shifter (S), and one 16-bit DT accumulator (Acc). The operations per cycle (OPC) of the proposed SFP LPFIR filter engine reaches 6, which enables efficient fabrication of the low-latency AFB for hearing aids. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed 16-bit SFP LPFIR filter engine, a 10-ms 18-band quasi-ANSI S1.11 1/3-octave AFB for digital hearing aids was implemented using UMC 90-nm CMOS technology. The AFB was operated at 792 kHz to process, in real-time, 24 kHz audio, with the power consumption being approximately 80.6 μW (at 1 V). Compared to the previous design in which the conventional PT datapath with integer arithmetic was used, approximately 9.6% of total power and 8.3% of silicon area were saved and almost the same SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) performance was achieved with the new system, when evaluated by a 3.96-s sequence of Mandarin speech. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we demonstrate that cisplatin treatment selects not only for resistance but also for a more oncogenic phenotype characterized by high self-renewal and invasive capabilities. These phenomena are likely due to STAT3 upregulatoin which occurred simultaneously with higher expression of Snail, an activator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in ATRT-CisR cells. STAT3 knockdown effectively suppressed Snail expression and blocked motility and invasion in ATRT-CisR cells, while overexpressing Snail reversed these effects. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that STAT3 directly bound to Snail promoter. Moreover, STAT3 knockdown effectively suppressed cancer stem-like properties, synergistically enhanced the chemotherapeutic effect, and significantly improved survival rate in ATRT-CisR-transplanted immunocompromised mice. Finally, immunohistochemistrical analysis showed that STAT3 and Snail were coexpressed at high levels in recurrent ATRT tissues. Thus, the STAT3/Snail pathway plays an important role in oncogenic resistance, rendering cells not only drugresistant but also increasingly oncogenic (invasion, EMT and recurrence).

The hydrophobic agent (CPT) was encapsulated via emulsion with an amphiphilic gelatin core, and subsequently mineralized by CaP-hydrophilic drug (DOX) through precipitation to form a CaP shell on the CPT-AG amphiphilic gelatin core so that drug molecules with different characteristics (i.e. hydrophobic and hydrophilic) can be encapsulated in different regions to avoid their interaction. The existence of the CaP shell can protect the DOX against free release and cause an increased transfer of DOX across membranes, overcoming multidrug resistance. Release studies from core-shell carriers showed the possibility of achieving sequential release of more than one type of drug by controlling the pH-sensitive CaP shell and degradable AG core. The highly pH-responsive behavior of the carrier can modulate the dual-drug-release of DOX/CPT, specifically in acidic intracellular pH environments. The AG/CPT@CaP-DOX nanoparticles also exhibited higher drug efficiencies against MCF-7/ADR cells than MCF-7 cells, thanks to a synergistic cell cycle arrest/apoptosis-inducing effect between CPT and DOX. As such, this core-shell system can serve as a general platform for the localized, controlled, sequential delivery of multiple drugs to treat several diseases, especially for multidrug-resistant cancer cells. ? 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

This study aims to establish whether there is an association between schizophrenia and CKD. Design: A nationwide matched cohort study. Setting: Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database.

Primary and secondary outcome measures: After making adjustments for confounding risk factors, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the risk of developing CKD during a 3-year follow-up period from the index date. Results: Of the 2338-subject case cohort, 163 (6.97%) developed a CKD, as did 365 (5.20%) of the 7014 control participants.

However, the objective evidence is scanty. Thoracoabdominal synchrony could be evaluated by calculating the phase angle between rib cage and abdomen motion in the Lissajous figure. A lesser phase angle indicates a better thoracoabdominal synchrony. Complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) was recently developed to extract the main component in the nonlinear and non-stationary signals. This study was designed to compare the thoracoabdominal synchrony between AB and TB via a CEEMD-based Lissajous figure analysis. Twenty-nine healthy subjects [24 males and 5 females; age 22 (21-23) years, median (interquartile range)] were recruited to receive simultaneous respiratory inductive plethysmography recording of rib cage and abdomen motion during AB and TB respectively. The main components of rib cage and abdomen motion were extracted by CEEMD. These main components were used to plot the Lissajous figure and calculate the phase angle. Compared with TB, AB revealed a significant decrease (P < 0-001) in phase angle [AB 12.13 (8.70-15.76)° vs. TB 22.56 (17.59-26.35)° ]. In conclusion, AB assumes a better thoracoabdominal synchrony than TB. This finding might help to explain why AB is a healthier pattern of breathing. In addition, the CEEMD-based Lissajous figure analysis could be an effective method for the evaluation of thoracoabdominal synchrony.

Thus, new antibacterial agents and therapeutics that can treat bacterial infections are necessary. Vancomycin is a potent antibiotic. Unfortunately, some bacterial strains have developed their resistance toward vancomycin. Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that vancomycin-immobilized nanoparticles (NPs) are capable to be used in inhibition of the cell growth of vancomycin-resistant bacterial strains through multivalent interactions. However, multistep syntheses are usually necessary to generate vancomycin-immobilized NPs. Thus, maintaining the antibiotic activity of vancomycin when the drug is immobilized on the surface of NPs is challenging. In this study, a facile approach to generate vancomycin immobilized gold (Van-Au) NPs through one-pot stirring of vancomycin with aqueous tetrachloroauric acid at pH 12 and 25 °C for 24 h was demonstrated. Van-Au NPs (8.4 ± 1.3 nm in size) were readily generated. The generated Van-Au NPs maintained their antibiotic activities and inhibited the cell growth of pathogens, which included Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. Furthermore, the minimum inhibitory concentration of the Van-Au NPs against bacteria was lower than that of free-form vancomycin. Staphylococcus aureus-infected macrophages were used as the model samples to examine the antibacterial activity of the Van-Au NPs. Macrophages have the tendency to engulf Van-Au NPs through endocytosis. The results showed that the cell growth of S. aureus in the macrophages was effectively inhibited, suggesting the potential of using the generated Van-Au NPs as antibacterial agents for bacterial infectious diseases. ? 2015 American Chemical Society.",antibiotics; gold nanoparticles; macrophage; pathogenic bacteria; Staphylococcus aureus; vancomycin,"Antibiotics; Cell growth; Gold; Gold alloys; Growth kinetics; Macrophages; Molecular biology; Nanoparticles; Antibiotic-resistant bacteria; Gold Nanoparticles; Immobilized nanoparticle; Minimum inhibitory concentration; Multivalent interactions; Pathogenic bacterium; Staphylococcus aureus; Vancomycin; Bacteria; antiinfective agent; drug carrier; nanoparticle; vancomycin; antibiotic resistance; chemistry; drug effects; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Carriers; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Nanoparticles; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus; Vancomycin",2-s2.0-84921772340

This study aims to model visual behaviors and to estimate the effects of various contributing factors on driver's vision transitions. A visual attention allocation framework, based on certain contributing attributes related to driving tasks and environmental conditions, has been developed. The associated logit type models for determining driver choices for focal points were successfully formulated and estimated by using naturalistic glance data from the 100-car event database. The results offer insights into driver visual behavior and patterns of visual attention allocation. The three focal points that drivers most frequently rely on and glance at are the forward, left and rear view mirror. The sample drivers were less likely to demonstrate troublesome transition patterns, particularly in mentally demanding situations. Additionally, instead of shifting vision directly between two non-forward focal points, the sample drivers frequently had an intermediate forward glance.

Finally, in addition to the vision-transition patterns, the potential pitfalls of such patterns and possible countermeasures to improving safety are illustrated, focusing on situations when drivers are distracted, traveling at high speeds and approaching intersections. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The submental flap is a versatile and time-effective option for reconstruction of orofacial defects providing acceptable cosmetic and functional results without requiring microsurgical techniques. A retrospective case series study of patients who underwent reconstruction with the submental flap between 2009 and 2013 was conducted. There were 36 patients (33 men and 3 women), with a mean age of 56.4 years, enrolled in this study. The primary lesion sites included oral cavity (24 patients), pharynx (8 patients), larynx (2 patients), neck (1 patient) as well as maxillary sinus (1 patient). All flaps were harvested as the myocutaneous flaps. All donor sites were closed primarily without the need of additional surgery. No complete loss of the flap was encountered and two cases developed marginal necrosis of the flap. The submental flap had a reliable pedicle and had minimal donor-site morbidity. It is an excellent flap option for patients with small- to medium-sized defects in head and neck region. ? 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Head neck defects; Reconstruction; Submental flap,"adult; Article; clinical article; female; graft necrosis; head and neck cancer; human; hypopharynx cancer; larynx carcinoma; male; maxilla sinus cancer; myocutaneous flap; neck cancer; priority journal; retrospective study; submental flap; tissue flap; tongue carcinoma; aged; carcinoma; Head and Neck Neoplasms; middle aged; myocutaneous flap; neck dissection; plastic surgery; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myocutaneous Flap; Neck Dissection; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-84946498382

Although some case reports have demonstrated a possible association, the results are currently inconclusive. Therefore, we conducted a nation-wide population study to investigate the incidence of active TB in HCV infected patients receiving IBT in Taiwan. Methods: This 9-year cohort study was based on the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID 2000) consisting of 1,000,000 beneficiaries randomly selected from all Taiwan National Health Insurance enrollees in 2000 ( >23.7 million). This insurance program covers all citizens in Taiwan. We conducted a retrospective cohort study that identified subjects with HCV infection. IBTs were defined as regimens that included interferon α, peginterferon α2a and peginterferon α2b for at least 2 months. Among them, 621 subjects received IBT, and 2,460 age- and gender-matched subjects were enrolled for analysis. The Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for active TB, and associated confidence intervals (CIs), comparing IBT cohort and untreated cohort. The endpoint in this study was whether an enrolled subject had a new diagnosis of active TB. Results: During the 9-year enrollment period, the treated and untreated cohorts were followed for a mean (± SD) duration of 6.97 ± 0.02 years and 8.21 ± 0.01 years, respectively. The cumulative incidence rate of active TB during this study period was 0.150 and 0.151 per 100 person-years in the IBT treated and untreated cohorts, respectively. There was no significant difference in the incidence of active TB in either cohort during a 1-year follow-up (Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR): 2.81, 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI): 0.61-12.98) or the long-term follow-up (AHR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.28 - 3.78). The Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated that IBT was not a risk factor for active TB . The only risk factor for active TB was the occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy. Conclusion: Our results showed that IBT is associated with increased hazard of active TB in HCV infected patients in 1-year follow-up; however, the effect sizes were not statistically significant. ?

Many approaches have been proposed to identify the potential targets of a drug. Recently, we have introduced Space-Related Pharmamotif (SRPmotif) method to recognize the proteins that share similar binding environments. In addition, compounds with similar topology may bind to similar proteins and have similar protein-compound interactions. However, few studies have focused on exploring the relationships between binding environments and protein-compound interactions, which is important for understanding molecular binding mechanisms and helpful to be used in discovering drug repurposing. Results: In this study, we propose a new concept of ""Homopharma"", combining similar binding environments and protein-compound interaction profiles, to explore the molecular binding mechanisms and drug repurposing. A Homopharma consists of a set of proteins which have the conserved binding environment and a set of compounds that share similar structures and functional groups. These proteins and compounds present conserved interactions and similar physicochemical properties. Therefore, these compounds are often able to inhibit the proteins in a Homopharma. Our experimental results show that the proteins and compounds in a Homopharma often have similar protein-compound interactions, comprising conserved specific residues and functional sites. Based on the Homopharma concept, we selected four flavonoid derivatives and 32 human protein kinases for enzymatic profiling. Among these 128 bioassays, the IC<inf>50</inf> of 56 and 25 flavonoid-kinase inhibitions are less than 10 μM and 1 μM, respectively. Furthermore, these experimental results suggest that these flavonoids can be used as anticancer compounds, such as oral and colorectal cancer drugs. Conclusions: The experimental results show that the Homopharma is useful for identifying key binding environments of proteins and compounds and discovering new inhibitory effects. We believe that the Homopharma concept can have the potential for understanding molecular binding mechanisms and providing new clues for drug development. ? 2014 Chiu et al.",,"aciclovir; antiestrogen; antineoplastic agent; dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor; flavonoid; methotrexate; protein kinase; protein kinase inhibitor; protein kinase Pim 1; serine; thymidine kinase; vidarabine; flavonoid; protein; protein binding; Article; bioassay; chemical analysis; chemical structure; crystal structure; drug protein binding; drug repositioning; drug research; enzyme analysis; homopharma; human; IC50; ligand binding; mathematical analysis; molecular binding; molecular interaction; physical chemistry; protein conformation; protein function; protein motif; protein structure; sequence alignment; biology; chemistry; computer interface; drug repositioning; metabolism; procedures; Amino Acid Motifs; Computational Biology; Drug Repositioning; Flavonoids; Humans; Models, Molecular; Protein Binding; Protein Kinases; Proteins; Thymidine Kinase; User-Computer Interface",2-s2.0-84939525503

The symptoms of hip fractures (e.g., severe pain and limited daily functions) are thought to cause acute stress to patients; however, the association between fractures and affective disorders is not fully understood. Aim: This nationwide population-based study aimed to analyze the risk of affective disorders in patients diagnosed with a hip fracture. Methods: We used data from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database. Patients who had a history of hip fracture and affective disorders prior to the study period were excluded. A total of 3865 patients who came to emergency departments for treatment of hip fractures between 2004 and 2009 were compared to 11,595 matched control individuals (without hip fracture). Each patient was followed for 1 year to identify episodes of affective disorders. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for residence and sociodemographic characteristics, were used to compare the risk of affective disorders in the study and control groups, and affective disorder-free survival curves were generated. Results: A total of 53 (1.4%) patients with hip fractures and 32 (0.3%) controls experienced incident affective disorders during the follow-up period. The stratified Cox proportional analysis indicated that the crude hazard ratio comparing the risk of affective disorders in patients with a hip fracture and in controls was 5.1 (95% confidence interval, 3.27-7.86). Most affective disorders (20.8%) presented during the first 60 days following the fracture. Conclusion: Individuals who experience a hip fracture are at a higher risk of developing affective disorders, and these disorders primarily occur during the first 60 days after the fracture. ? 2014, Taiwan Society of Emergency Medicine.",Affective disorders; Database; Hip fracture,acute disease; adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; confidence interval; controlled study; demography; disease association; disease free survival; emergency ward; female; follow up; hazard ratio; high risk patient; hip fracture; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mood disorder; population; priority journal; proportional hazards model; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; social status; Taiwan; very elderly,2-s2.0-84922906513

The chip has eight on-chip sensors, an adaptive interface, a successive approximation analog-to-digital converter (SAR ADC), a learning kernel of continuous restricted Boltzmann machine (CRBM), and a RISC-core with low-voltage SRAM. The functionality of VAP identification was verified using clinical data. In total, 76 samples infected with pneumonia (19 Klebsiella, 25 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 Staphylococcus aureus, and 16 Candida) and 41 uninfected samples were collected as the experimental group and the control group, respectively. The results revealed a very high VAP identification rate at 94.06% for identifying healthy and infected patients. A 100% accuracy to identify the microorganisms of Klebsiella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida from VAP infected patients was achieved.

Various tools have been developed to predict linear or conformational epitopes, each relying on different physicochemical properties and adopting distinct search strategies. We propose a meta-learning approach for epitope prediction based on stacked and cascade generalizations. Through meta learning, we expect a meta learner to be able integrate multiple prediction models, and outperform the single best-performing model. The objective of this study is twofold: (1) to analyze the complementary predictive strengths in different prediction tools, and (2) to introduce a generic computational model to exploit the synergy among various prediction tools. Our primary goal is not to develop any particular classifier for B-cell epitope prediction, but to advocate the feasibility of meta learning to epitope prediction. With the flexibility of meta learning, the researcher can construct various meta classification hierarchies that are applicable to epitope prediction in different protein domains. Results: We developed the hierarchical meta-learning architectures based on stacked and cascade generalizations. The bottom level of the hierarchy consisted of four conformational and four linear epitope prediction tools that served as the base learners. To perform consistent and unbiased comparisons, we tested the meta-learning method on an independent set of antigen proteins that were not used previously to train the base epitope prediction tools. In addition, we conducted correlation and ablation studies of the base learners in the meta-learning model. Low correlation among the predictions of the base learners suggested that the eight base learners had complementary predictive capabilities. The ablation analysis indicated that the eight base learners differentially interacted and contributed to the final meta model. The results of the independent test demonstrated that the meta-learning approach markedly outperformed the single best-performing epitope predictor. Conclusions: Computational B-cell epitope prediction tools exhibit several differences that affect their performances when predicting epitopic regions in protein antigens. The proposed meta-learning approach for epitope prediction combines multiple prediction tools by integrating their complementary predictive strengths. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the combined approach in comparison with single epitope predictors. ? 2014 Hu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",B-cell epitope prediction; Conformational epitopes; Linear epitopes; Meta learning,"Ablation; Antigens; Cells; Cytology; Forecasting; Learning systems; Proteins; Viruses; B cells; Cascade generalization; Conformational epitopes; Linear epitopes; Meta-learning approach; Metalearning; Physicochemical property; Predictive capabilities; Epitopes; epitope; algorithm; artificial intelligence; B lymphocyte; biological model; chemistry; computer simulation; conformation; immunology; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; B-Lymphocytes; Computer Simulation; Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte; Models, Biological; Molecular Conformation",2-s2.0-84921953220

An ultrasensitive and amplified electrochemical sandwich assay using screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) strips for thrombin detection was established in this study. The conductivity and sensing performance of the carbon electrodes were enhanced by using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The aptamer addressed on the strips was used as a primary probe to capture thrombin in the detected samples. An amplifier was invented for recognizing thrombin captured on the SPCE, which is the multiple molecules of anti-thrombin antibody (Ab) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) co-modified AuNPs (AuNPs/Ab-HRP). Hydrogen peroxide was used as the substrate for HRP and then the response current (RC) could be detected. The optimization of these AuNPs conjugates-amplified aptamer immunosensing SPCE strips was conducted for thrombin detection.

Here, we show that survivin and p53 display the opposite role on the regulation of honokiol-induced apoptosis in the human colorectal cancer cells. Honokiol induced the cell death and apoptosis in various colorectal cancer cell lines. Moreover, honokiol elicited the extrinsic death receptor pathway of DR5 and caspase 8 and the intrinsic pathway of caspase 9. The common intrinsic and extrinsic downstream targets of activated caspase 3 and PARP protein cleavage were induced by honokiol. Interestingly, honokiol reduced anti-apoptotic survivin protein and gene expression. Transfection with a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-survivin-expressed vector increased the colorectal cancer cell viability and resisted the honokiol-induced apoptosis. Meantime, honokiol increased total p53 and the phosphorylated p53 proteins at Ser15 and Ser46. The p53-wild type colorectal cancer cells were exhibited greater cytotoxicity, apoptosis and survivin reduction than the p53-null cancer cells after treatment with honokiol. Together, these findings demonstrate that the existence of survivin and p53 can modulate the honokiol-induced apoptosis in the human colorectal cancer cells. J. Cell.

Unfortunately, the rapid development of cities and increased numbers of vehicles are preventing emergency vehicles from easily reaching locations where they are needed. A significant number of researchers are experimenting with vehicular networks to address this issue, but in most studies the focus has been on communication technologies and protocols, with few efforts to assess how network applications actually support emergency medical care. Our motivation was to search the literature for suggested methods for assisting emergency vehicles, and to use simulations to evaluate them. Our results and evidence-based studies were cross-referenced to assess each method in terms of cumulative survival ratio (CSR) gains for acute and critically ill patients. Simulation results indicate that traffic light preemption resulted in significant CSR increases of between 32.4% and 90.2%. Route guidance was found to increase CSRs from 14.1% to 57.8%, while path clearing increased CSRs by 15.5% or less.

However, only few types of bacteria were taken into consideration while using PCR-based or culturing methods. Here we present an analysis approach using next-generation sequencing technology and bioinformatics analysis to investigate the associations between bacterial communities and semen quality. Ninety-six semen samples collected were examined for bacterial communities, measuring seven clinical criteria for semen quality (semen volume, sperm concentration, motility, Kruger's strict morphology, antisperm antibody (IgA), Atypical, and leukocytes). Computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA) was also performed. Results showed that the most abundant genera among all samples were Lactobacillus (19.9%), Pseudomonas (9.85%), Prevotella (8.51%) and Gardnerella (4.21%). The proportion of Lactobacillus and Gardnerella was significantly higher in the normal samples, while that of Prevotella was significantly higher in the low quality samples. Unsupervised clustering analysis demonstrated that the seminal bacterial communities were clustered into three main groups: Lactobacillus, Pseudomonas, and Prevotella predominant group. Remarkably, most normal samples (80.6%) were clustered in Lactobacillus predominant group. The analysis results showed seminal bacteria community types were highly associated with semen health. Lactobacillus might not only be a potential probiotic for semen quality maintenance, but also might be helpful in countering the negative influence of Prevotella and Pseudomonas. In this study, we investigated whole seminal bacterial communities and provided the most comprehensive analysis of the association between bacterial community and semen quality. The study significantly contributes to the current understanding of the etiology of male fertility. ? 2014 Weng et al.",,"immunoglobulin A; biological marker; adult; Aggregatibacter; Article; Atopobium; bacterium detection; bacterium identification; Brevibacterium; Campylobacter; cell structure; cell volume; Gardnerella; Haemophilus; human; human cell; Lactobacillus; leukocyte; major clinical study; male; male fertility; male infertility; metagenomics; microbial community; microbial diversity; Pasteurella; Peptoniphilus; Prevotella; Pseudomonas; semen analysis; species richness; sperm quality; spermatozoon density; spermatozoon motility; bacterium; biodiversity; case control study; cluster analysis; demography; DNA sequence; genetics; male infertility; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; middle aged; principal component analysis; semen analysis; species difference; sperm; Bacteria (microorganisms); Adult; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Biological Markers; Case-Control Studies; Cluster Analysis; Demography; Humans; Infertility, Male; Male; Metagenomics; Microbiota; Middle Aged; Principal Component Analysis; Semen; Semen Analysis; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Species Specificity",2-s2.0-84908439922

In the early stage of diabetes, symptoms are unobvious, but they usually induce diabetic autonomic neuropathy or, worse, cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy. Pupillometers are effective instruments for observing human pupils. This article presents a novel wearable pupillometer design, without external light artifacts, and an embedded algorithm with blinking elimination, which investigates autonomic neuropathy through recording pupil dynamics triggered by an external sensitive invisible light source. The pupillometer is experimented on 36 healthy subjects and 10 diabetic patients under four different colors (white, red, green, and blue) as well as two different light intensities: 50 and 500 mcd. Ten parameters derived from pupil diameter, pupil response time, and pupil response speed will be evaluated for the healthy subjects and diabetic patients. The results show that three in four parameters related to pupil diameters, one in four related to light intensities, and one in two related to pupil response speed could have significant differences (p < 0.05) between healthy subjects and diabetic patients. These parameters obtain over 85% sensitivity, 83% specificity, and 88% accuracy.

The diagnosis was confirmed by surgery and pathology. Demographic characteristics, manifestations, Meckels scan results, surgical and histological findings were analyzed.Results: One hundred symptomatic Meckels diverticula were identified in 74 boys and 26 girls aged from one day to 18 years old over 13 years. Depending on whether or not obstruction occurred, the patients were classified into two categories. Each category was further subdivided into two diagnostic groups: 17 intussusception and 24 non-intussusception bowel obstruction in the obstructive category and 44 gastrointestinal bleeding and 15 diverticulitis and/or perforation in the non-obstructive category. The sex discrepancy was higher in the non-obstructive category than in the obstructive category (male-to-female, 4.36 vs. 1.73, p < 0.05). Forty-one of 44 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding underwent a Meckels scan with a high positive rate (92.7%). The ectopic tissues were identified in 73 patients and included 61 gastric type, two pancreatic type and 10 mixed type. Ectopic tissues were more prevalent in non-obstructive category (p < 0.05) with ectopic gastric tissue even more pronounced (p < 0.01). Ectopic pancreatic tissue was significantly more prevalent in intussusception (p < 0.01). Laparoscopic surgery was performed more frequently in Meckels diverticulum with non-obstructive symptoms (p < 0.001).Conclusion: Diverse presentations in pediatric Meckels diverticulum are affected by different ectopic tissue types and male sex.

Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is the cellular receptor for CpG-ODN in mammalian cells. The CpG-ODN with 18-24 deoxynucleotides that are in current use for human and mouse cells, however, have low activity with rabbit TLR9. Using a cell-based activation assay, we developed a type of CpG-ODN containing a GACGTT or AACGTT motif in 12 phosphorothioate-modified deoxynucleotides with potent stimulatory activity for rabbit TLR9. The developed CpG-ODN have higher activities than other developed CpG-ODN in eliciting antigen-nonspecific immune responses in rabbit splenocytes. When mixed with an NJ85 peptide derived from rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, they had potent activities to boost an antigen-specific T cell activation and antibody production in rabbits. Compared to Freund's adjuvant, the developed CpG-ODN are capable of boosting a potent and less toxic antibody response. The results of this study suggest that both the choice of CpG-motif and its length are important factors for CpG-ODN to effectively activate rabbit TLR9 mediated immune responses.

In the present study, we tested the efficacy of tamoxifen in a panel of ER-negative breast cancer cell lines and examined the drug mechanism.Methods: In total, five ER-negative breast cancer cell lines (HCC-1937, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453 and SK-BR-3) were used for in vitro studies. Cellular apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. Signal transduction pathways in cells were assessed by Western blot analysis. The in vivo efficacy of tamoxifen was tested in xenograft nude mice. Results: Tamoxifen induced significant apoptosis in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453 and SK-BR-3 cells, but not in HCC-1937 cells. Tamoxifen-induced apoptosis was associated with inhibition of cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) and phospho-Akt (p-Akt) in a dose-dependent manner. Ectopic expression of either CIP2A or Akt protected MDA-MB-231 cells from tamoxifen-induced apoptosis. In addition, tamoxifen increased protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, and tamoxifen-induced apoptosis was attenuated by the PP2A antagonist okadaic acid in the sensitive cell lines, but not in resistant HCC-1937 cells. Moreover, silencing CIP2A by small interfering RNA sensitized HCC-1937 cells to tamoxifen-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, tamoxifen regulated CIP2A protein expression by downregulating CIP2A mRNA. Importantly, tamoxifen inhibited the in vivo growth of MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors in association with CIP2A downregulation, whereas tamoxifen had no significant effect on CIP2A expression and anti-tumor growth in HCC-1937 tumors. Conclusions: Inhibition of CIP2A determines the effects of tamoxifen-induced apoptosis in ER-negative breast cancer cells. Our data suggest a novel ""off-target"" mechanism of tamoxifen and suggest that CIP2A/PP2A/p-Akt signaling may be a feasible anti-cancer pathway. ? 2014 Liu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"estrogen receptor alpha; messenger RNA; okadaic acid; phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A; protein kinase B; small interfering RNA; tamoxifen citrate; antineoplastic hormone agonists and antagonists; autoantigen; estrogen receptor; KIAA1524 protein, human; membrane protein; protein kinase B; tamoxifen; adult; aged; animal experiment; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; breast cancer; cancer inhibition; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; down regulation; drug efficacy; enzyme activity; enzyme inactivation; flow cytometry; human; human cell; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; tumor xenograft; Western blotting; animal; Breast Neoplasms; drug effects; drug screening; female; genetic transcription; genetics; Kaplan Meier method; male; metabolism; middle aged; mortality; nude mouse; pathology; tumor cell line; tumor volume; Aged; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Apoptosis; Autoantigens; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Down-Regulation; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Membrane Proteins; Mice, Nude; Middle Aged; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Receptors, Estrogen; Tamoxifen; Transcription, Genetic; Tumor Burden; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-84908092772

Securin plays pivotal role in cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Here, we report the presence of securin that could modulate apoptosis and tumor growth ability in the butein-treated human colorectal cancer. Butein induced caspase-3 activation and PARP protein cleavage for apoptosis induction in human colorectal cancer cells. Interestingly, butein reduced the securin protein levels but conversely increased the phospho-histone H3 proteins, mitotic arrest and abnormal chromosomes segregation in cancer cells. The securin-null colorectal cancer cells were more sensitive on the reduction of cell viability than the securin-wild type cancer cells following butein treatment. The loss of securin in human colorectal cancer cells decreased tumor growth ability in nude mice. Moreover, butein reduced the tumor size of xenografted human colorectal tumors of nude mice.

In particular, multiphoton microscopy is useful in imaging intracellular events, such as mitochondrial depolarization and cellular metabolism in terms of NAD(P)H changes with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. The morphology of hepatocytes can be visualized without exogenously administered fluorescent dyes by utilizing their autofluorescence and second harmonic generation signal of collagen, which is useful in diagnosing liver disease. More specific imaging, such as studying drug transport in normal and diseased livers are achievable, but require exogenously administered fluorescent dyes. If these techniques can be translated into clinical use to assess liver function, it would greatly improve early diagnosis of organ viability, fibrosis, and cancer. ?

Many studies have now shown that miRNAs are involved in the initiation and progression of cancers. In this study, procedures based on the relative R-squared method (RRSM) are proposed to investigate miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships between 114 miRNAs and 16063 mRNAs for different organic tissues. These procedures are based on comparing the expression profiles in tumor tissue and those in normal tissues, or based on the expression profiles in tumor tissue only. The analyzed results are used to predict high-confident miRNAs for tumor development and their targets. This study predicts many high-confident miRNAs which are associated with colon cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer and kidney cancer, respectively. ? 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.",Cancer; Microarray expression profile; MicroRNA; Normal tissue; The relative R-squared method; Tumor tissue,"epidermal growth factor receptor; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA 1; microRNA 100; microRNA 124a; microRNA 125b; microRNA 143; microRNA 145; microRNA 155; microRNA 193; microRNA 194; microRNA 199a; microRNA 200; microRNA 200a; microRNA 200b; microRNA 200c; microRNA 205; microRNA 206; microRNA 21; microRNA 216; microRNA 218; microRNA 22; microRNA 223; microRNA 29a; microRNA 29b; microRNA 30b; microRNA 34a; microRNA 99a; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; microRNA; apoptosis; Article; bladder cancer; breast cancer; cancer tissue; colon cancer; comparative study; gene expression; gene mutation; genetic association; human; kidney cancer; lung cancer; microarray analysis; neoplasm; oncogene; pancreas cancer; prostate cancer; statistical analysis; animal; biosynthesis; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; neoplasm; Animals; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; MicroRNAs; Neoplasms",2-s2.0-84907169675

It has been found that the intrinsic characteristics of blood vessels can be assessed quantitatively by ABP analysis (called reflection wave analysis (RWA)), but conventional RWA is insufficient for assessment during non-stationary conditions, such as the Valsalva maneuver. Recently, a novel adaptive method called empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was proposed for non-stationary data analysis. This study proposed a RWA algorithm based on EMD (EMD-RWA). A total of 51 subjects participated in this study, including 39 healthy subjects and 12 patients with autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction. The results showed that EMD-RWA provided a reliable estimation of reflection time in baseline and head-up tilt (HUT). Moreover, the estimated reflection time is able to assess the ANS function non-invasively, both in normal, healthy subjects and in the patients with ANS dysfunction. EMD-RWA provides a new approach for reflection time estimation in non-stationary conditions, and also helps with non-invasive ANS assessment. ? 2014 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",arterial blood pressure; autonomic nervous system; empirical mode decomposition; intrinsic mode function; reflection wave analysis,"adult; aged; algorithm; autonomic nervous system; blood pressure; blood pressure measurement; body posture; human; middle aged; movement (physiology); pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; reproducibility; signal processing; Valsalva maneuver; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Autonomic Nervous System; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Determination; Humans; Middle Aged; Movement; Posture; Reproducibility of Results; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Valsalva Maneuver",2-s2.0-84906729851

WNK1 causes hypertension and hyperkalemia when overexpressed and cardiovascular defects when ablated in mice. In this study, the role of Wnk1 in angiogenesis was explored using the zebrafish model. There are two zebrafish wnk1 isoforms, wnk1a and wnk1b, and both contain all the functional domains found in the human WNK1 protein. Both isoforms are expressed in the embryo at the initiation of angiogenesis and in the posterior cardinal vein (PCV), similar to fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (flt4). Using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides against wnk1a and wnk1b, we observed that wnk1 morphants have defects in angiogenesis in the head and trunk, similar to flk1/vegfr2 morphants. Furthermore, both wnk1a and wnk1b mRNA can partially rescue the defects in vascular formation caused by flk1/vegfr2 knockdown. Mutation of the kinase domain or the Akt/PI3K phosphorylation site within wnk1 destroys this rescue capability. The rescue experiments provide evidence that wnk1 is a downstream target for Vegfr2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2) and Akt/PI3K signaling and thereby affects angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (flk1 /vegfr2 ) or vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (flt4/vegfr3) results in a decrease in wnk1a expression, as assessed by in situ hybridization and q-RT-PCR analysis. Thus, the Vegf/Vegfr signaling pathway controls angiogenesis in zebrafish via Akt kinase-mediated phosphorylation and activation of Wnk1 as well as transcriptional regulation of wnk1 expression. ? 2014 Lai et al.",,"antisense oligonucleotide; messenger RNA; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate 3 kinase; protein kinase B; protein kinase WNK1; protein kinase WNK1a; protein kinase WNK1b; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; vasculotropin receptor 2; vasculotropin receptor 3; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; protein serine threonine kinase; vasculotropin A; vasculotropin receptor 2; vasculotropin receptor 3; VEGFR-2 protein, zebrafish; zebrafish protein; adult; amino acid sequence; angiogenesis; animal experiment; article; controlled study; down regulation; embryo; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme phosphorylation; female; gene expression regulation; gene silencing; in situ hybridization; intracellular signaling; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA sequence; transcription regulation; transgenic zebrafish; wild type; angiogenesis; animal; metabolism; neovascularization (pathology); phosphorylation; physiology; signal transduction; zebra fish; Animals; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Phosphorylation; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Signal Transduction; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins",2-s2.0-84909604309

Increased red cell distribution width (RDW) is a strong independent predictor for adverse outcomes in ACS. The common underlying mechanism for anemia and increased RDW value is iron deficiency. It is not clear whether serum iron deficiency without anemia affects left ventricular (LV) performance after primary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We investigated the prognostic value of serum iron concentration on LV ejection fraction (EF) at 6 months and its relationship to thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) risk score in post MI patients. Methods: We recruited 55 patients who were scheduled to undergo primary coronary balloon angioplasty after AMI and 54 age- and sex-matched volunteers. Serum iron concentration and interleukin-6 levels were measured before primary angioplasty. LVEF was measured by echocardiography at baseline and after 6 months. TIMI risk score was calculated for risk stratification. Results: Serum iron concentration was significantly lower in those in whom LVEF had not improved ?10% from baseline (52.7±24.1 versus 80.8±50.8 μg/dl, P = 0.016) regardless of hemoglobin level, and was significantly lower in the AMI group than in the control group (62.5±37.7 versus 103.0±38.1 μg/dl, P<0.001). Trend analysis revealed that serum iron concentration decreased as TIMI risk score increased (P = 0.002). In addition, lower serum iron concentrations were associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers. Multiple linear regression showed that baseline serum iron concentration can predict LV systolic function 6 months after primary angioplasty for AMI even after adjusting for traditional prognostic factors. Conclusion: Hypoferremia is not only a marker of inflammation but also a potential prognostic factor for LV systolic function after revascularization therapy for AMI, and may be a novel biomarker for therapeutic intervention. ? 2014 Huang et al.",,"creatine kinase MB; hemoglobin; interleukin 6; iron; troponin I; biological marker; hemoglobin; iron; acute heart infarction; adult; angiocardiography; article; cardiovascular risk; controlled study; echocardiography; ELISA kit; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; erythrocyte function and characteristics; female; follow up; heart left ventricle contraction; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle performance; hemoglobin blood level; human; iron blood level; iron deficiency; major clinical study; male; multiple linear regression analysis; named inventories, questionnaires and rating scales; prediction; prognosis; prospective study; red cell distribution width; risk assessment; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; thrombolysis in myocardial infarction risk score; transluminal coronary angioplasty; acute coronary syndrome; aged; blood; clinical trial; heart stroke volume; heart ventricle; metabolism; middle aged; Myocardial Infarction; pathophysiology; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Adult; Aged; Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary; Biomarkers; Female; Heart Ventricles; Hemoglobins; Humans; Iron; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Prospective Studies; Stroke Volume",2-s2.0-84905495706

The proposed method, named as Pitch based Formant Estimation (PFE-AFC), has significantly low complexity compared to Prediction Error Method AFC (PEM-AFC). The proposed PFE-AFC consists of a forward and a backward path processing. The forward path processing includes a low complexity pitch based formant estimator for decorrelation filter coefficients update and a pitch based voice activity detector for speech detection, which facilitates the feedback cancellation filter in the backward path to reduce feedback component and maintain speech quality. From system point of view, the PFE-AFC has low complexity overhead since it is easy to share computation resource with other components in the HA system, such as noise reduction and auditory compensation. In addition, the PFE-AFC is suitable for hardware implementation owing to its regular structure. Complexity evaluations show that the PFE-AFC has four orders lower complexity than the PEM-AFC. Simulation results show that the PFE-AFC and the PEM-AFC can achieve similar PESQ (perceptual evaluation speech quality) and ASG (added stable gain). Moreover, the proposed PFE-AFC can outperform the conventional AFC. ? 2014 IEEE.",Adaptive feedback cancellation; Hearing aid application; Voice activity detection,Algorithms; Continuous speech recognition; Error analysis; Hardware; Hearing aids; Noise abatement; Quality control; Adaptive feedback cancellation; Feedback cancellation; Hardware implementations; Hearing aid; Perceptual evaluation; Prediction error method; Voice activity detection; Voice activity detectors; Audition,2-s2.0-84911467326

We hypothesized that Centella asiatica, a herb traditionally being used to improve memory, prevents diabetes-related hippocampal dysfunction. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the protective role of C. asiatica on the hippocampus in diabetes. Methods. Streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced adult male diabetic rats received 100 and 200 mg/kg/day body weight (b.w) C. asiatica leaf aqueous extract for four consecutive weeks. Following sacrifice, hippocampus was removed and hippocampal tissue homogenates were analyzed for Na+/K+-, Ca2+- And Mg2+-ATPases activity levels. Levels of the markers of inflammation (tumor necrosis factor, TNF-; interleukin, IL-6; and interleukin, IL-1β) and oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation product: LPO, superoxide dismutase: SOD, catalase: CAT, and glutathione peroxidase: GPx) were determined.

We conducted a nationwide, population-based, propensity score-matched cohort study with the Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. All patients with IE between January 2000 and December 2010 were enrolled. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome included all-cause mortality within the first 3 months, 6 months, and one year after the diagnosis of IE. Among 13,584 patients with IE, we applied propensity score-matching on a 1:4 ratio, in which 370 statin users were matched to 1,480 statin non-users. Compared with statin non-users, statin users had a significantly lower risk of in-hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-0.86). The reduction in mortality from IE remained significant for follow-up 3 months (aHR 0.68, 95% CI, 0.53-0.88), 6 months (aHR 0.73, 95% CI, 0.58-0.91), and 12 months (aHR 0.68, 95% CI, 0.55-0.84). Statin therapy was associated with a reduced risk of ICU admission rates, shock events, the need for mechanical ventilation, but not significantly with the need for heart valvular replacement surgery. In conclusion, our study found that statin therapy is associated with a reduced risk of in-hospital and subsequent mortality of IE. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc.

DNA-binding proteins such as transcription factors, epigenetic and chromatin modifiers are responsible for regulating specific gene expression pattern and may result in different phenotypes. To reveal the identity of the proteins associated with the specific region on DNA, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is the most widely used technique. ChIP assay followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) or microarray (ChIP-chip) is often used to study patterns of protein-binding profiles in different cell types and in cancer samples on a genome-wide scale. However, only a limited number of bioinformatics tools are available for ChIP datasets analysis.Results: We present ChIPseek, a web-based tool for ChIP data analysis providing summary statistics in graphs and offering several commonly demanded analyses. ChIPseek can provide statistical summary of the dataset including histogram of peak length distribution, histogram of distances to the nearest transcription start site (TSS), and pie chart (or bar chart) of genomic locations for users to have a comprehensive view on the dataset for further analysis. For examining the potential functions of peaks, ChIPseek provides peak annotation, visualization of peak genomic location, motif identification, sequence extraction, and comparison between datasets. Beyond that, ChIPseek also offers users the flexibility to filter peaks and re-analyze the filtered subset of peaks. ChIPseek supports 20 different genome assemblies for 12 model organisms including human, mouse, rat, worm, fly, frog, zebrafish, chicken, yeast, fission yeast, Arabidopsis, and rice. We use demo datasets to demonstrate the usage and intuitive user interface of ChIPseek.Conclusions: ChIPseek provides a user-friendly interface for biologists to analyze large-scale ChIP data without requiring any programing skills. All the results and figures produced by ChIPseek can be downloaded for further analysis. The analysis tools built into ChIPseek, especially the ones for selecting and examine a subset of peaks from ChIP data, provides invaluable helps for exploring the high through-put data from either ChIP-seq or ChIP-chip.

Yet the development of novel drugs against MTB has been lagging. One potentially powerful approach to drug development is computation-aided repositioning of current drugs. However, the effectiveness of this approach has rarely been examined. Here we select the ""TB drugome"" approach - a protein structure-based method for drug repositioning for tuberculosis treatment - to (1) experimentally validate the efficacy of the identified drug candidates for inhibiting MTB growth, and (2) computationally examine how consistently drug candidates are prioritized, considering changes in input data. Twenty three drugs in the TB drugome were tested. Of them, only two drugs (tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen) effectively suppressed MTB growth at relatively high concentrations. Both drugs significantly enhanced the inhibitory effects of three first-line anti-TB drugs (rifampin, isoniazid, and ethambutol). However, tamoxifen is not a top-listed drug in the TB drugome, and 4-hydroxytamoxifen is not approved for use in humans. Computational re-examination of the TB drugome indicated that the rankings were subject to technical and data-related biases. Thus, although our results support the effectiveness of the TB drugome approach for identifying drugs that can potentially be repositioned for stand-alone applications or for combination treatments for TB, the approach requires further refinements via incorporation of additional biological information. Our findings can also be extended to other structure-based drug repositioning methods. ? 2014 Chen et al.",,"afimoxifene; amantadine; cytarabine; darunavir; dexamethasone; estradiol; ethambutol; fluconazole; indinavir; indometacin; isoniazid; isotretinoin; levothyroxine; liothyronine; lopinavir; methotrexate; nelfinavir; penicillamine; progesterone; propofol; raloxifene; rifampicin; ritonavir; spironolactone; tamoxifen; trimethoprim; afimoxifene; bacterial protein; drug combination; ethambutol; isoniazid; rifampicin; tamoxifen; tuberculostatic agent; antibacterial activity; article; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug inhibition; drug repositioning; empirical research; methodology; minimum inhibitory concentration; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; tuberculosis; tuberculosis drugome approach; analogs and derivatives; antagonists and inhibitors; antibiotic resistance; drug combination; drug effects; human; metabolism; microbial sensitivity test; tuberculosis; Antitubercular Agents; Bacterial Proteins; Drug Combinations; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Ethambutol; Humans; Isoniazid; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Rifampin; Tamoxifen; Tuberculosis",2-s2.0-84903398730

Here, we investigated the role of collagen type XI alpha 1 (COL11A1) in cell invasiveness and tumor formation and the prognostic impact of COL11A1 expression in ovarian cancer. Microarray analysis suggested that COL11A1 is a disease progression-associated gene that is linked to ovarian cancer recurrence and poor survival. Small interference RNA-mediated specific reduction in COL11A1 protein levels suppressed the invasive ability and oncogenic potential of ovarian cancer cells and decreased tumor formation and lung colonization in mouse xenografts. A combination of experimental approaches, including real-time RT-PCR, casein zymography and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, showed that COL11A1 knockdown attenuated MMP3 expression and suppressed binding of Ets-1 to its putative MMP3 promoter-binding site, suggesting that the Ets-1-MMP3 axis is upregulated by COL11A1. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta (TGF-β1) treatment triggers the activation of smad2 signaling cascades, leading to activation of COL11A1 and MMP3. Pharmacological inhibition of MMP3 abrogated the TGF-β1-triggered, COL11A1-dependent cell invasiveness. Furthermore, the NF-YA-binding site on the COL11A1 promoter was identified as the major determinant of TGF-β1-dependent COL11A1 activation. Analysis of 88 ovarian cancer patients indicated that high COL11A1 mRNA levels are associated with advanced disease stage. The 5-year recurrence-free and overall survival rates were significantly lower (P=0.006 and P=0.018, respectively) among patients with high expression levels of tissue COL11A1 mRNA compared with those with low expression. We conclude that COL11A1 may promote tumor aggressiveness via the TGF-β1-MMP3 axis and that COL11A1 expression can predict clinical outcome in ovarian cancer patients. ? 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",COL11A1; ovarian carcinoma; tumor progression,"collagen type 11; collagen type 11 alpha1; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; messenger RNA; stromelysin; transcription factor Ets 1; transforming growth factor beta1; unclassified drug; COL11A1 protein, human; collagen type 11; ETS1 protein, human; messenger RNA; MMP3 protein, human; Smad2 protein; SMAD2 protein, human; small interfering RNA; stromelysin; transcription factor Ets 1; transforming growth factor beta1; tumor marker; adult; amino acid sequence; article; cancer cell; cancer prognosis; cell growth; cell invasion; controlled study; female; human; human cell; human tissue; major clinical study; nucleotide sequence; ovary cancer; overall survival; priority journal; promoter region; protein binding; protein expression; protein function; recurrence free survival; signal transduction; upregulation; animal; biosynthesis; cancer transplantation; disease course; DNA microarray; gene expression profiling; genetics; metabolism; middle aged; mortality; mouse; ovary tumor; RNA interference; SCID mouse; survival rate; treatment outcome; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; tumor recurrence; xenograft; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Collagen Type XI; Disease Progression; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Matrix Metalloproteinase 3; Mice; Mice, SCID; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm Transplantation; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Ovarian Neoplasms; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1; RNA Interference; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Small Interfering; Signal Transduction; Smad2 Protein; Survival Rate; Transforming Growth Factor beta1; Transplantation, Heterologous; Treatment Outcome; Tumor Markers, Biological",2-s2.0-84903633634

However, the majority of genetic variants contributing to disease susceptibility are yet to be discovered. It is now widely believed that multiple rare variants are likely to be associated with complex diseases. Using custom-made chips or next-generation sequencing to uncover the effects of rare variants on the disease can be very expensive in current technology. Consequently, many researchers use the genotype imputation approach to predict the genotypes at these rare variants that are not directly genotyped in the study sample. One important question in genotype imputation is how to choose a reference panel that will produce high imputation accuracy in a population of interest. Using whole genome sequence data from the Genetic Analysis Workshop 18 data set, this report compares genotype imputation accuracy among reference panels representing different degrees of genetic similarity to a study sample of admixed Mexican Americans. Results show that a reference panel that closely matches the ancestry of the study population can increase imputation accuracy, but it can also result in more missing genotype calls. Having a larger-size reference panel can reduce imputation error and missing genotype, but the improvement may be limited. We also find that, for the admixed study sample, the simple selection of a single best-reference panel among HapMap African, European, or Asian population is not appropriate. The composite reference panel combining all available reference data should be used. ? 2014 Huang and Tseng; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,African; Asian; chromosome 3; Conference Paper; European; genetic analysis; genetic variation; genotyping technique; human; Mexican American; next generation sequencing; single nucleotide polymorphism; whole genome sequencing,2-s2.0-85018193345

The therapeutic efficacy often depends not only on the stabilization of the peptides but also on their binding specificity and affinity to the target molecules to interfere with designated molecular interaction. In this study, the binding affinity of human intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) chimera and leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) derived peptides was measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection, and the results were compared with that of the interaction (of ICAM-1) with the LFA-1 whole protein. To mimic diverse pathological situations in vivo where a low pH has been reported, we studied pH regulated binding affinity of ICAM-1/LFA-1 at pH 7.4, 6.5, and 4.0 without and with magnesium ion. We have found that the binding affinity of LFA-1 whole protein and ICAM-1 increases significantly as the environmental pH decreases, regardless of the absence or the presence of magnesium ion. The affinity of different (LFA-1) derived peptides also depends on the pH, although in all cases the peptides retain its ability to inhibit ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction. The biomedical relevance of these data has been confirmed using a cell aggregation assay, suggesting that LFA-1 derived peptides show great potential for peptide drug development with a wide functional window of pH range for potential applications in LFA-1 related tumor therapy and autoimmune disease treatment. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Acid pH; ICAM-1; LFA-1; Peptide drug; Surface plasmon resonance (SPR),Binding specificities; Cell aggregation assays; ICAM-1; Intercellular adhesion molecule-1; LFA-1; Pathological situations; Peptide drugs; Therapeutic Application; Binding energy; Cell adhesion; Disease control; Metal ions; Molecules; Peptides; Plasmons; Surface plasmon resonance; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; lymphocyte function associated antigen 1; magnesium ion; acidity; article; binding affinity; cell aggregation; controlled study; human; human cell; in vivo study; microenvironment; molecular interaction; molecular mechanics; pH; protein binding; protein protein interaction; protein synthesis inhibition; surface plasmon resonance; Acid pH; ICAM-1; LFA-1; Peptide drug; Surface plasmon resonance (SPR); Cell Line; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1; Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1; Magnesium; Peptides; Protein Binding; Protein Interaction Mapping; Protein Interaction Maps; Recombinant Proteins; Surface Plasmon Resonance,2-s2.0-84893169475

In this paper, we report an attempt to develop a pervasive on-line EEG-BCI system using state-of-art technologies including multi-tier Fog and Cloud Computing, semantic Linked Data search, and adaptive prediction/classification models. To verify our approach, we implement a pilot system by employing wireless dry-electrode EEG headsets and MEMS motion sensors as the front-end devices, Android mobile phones as the personal user interfaces, compact personal computers as the near-end Fog Servers and the computer clusters hosted by the Taiwan National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC) as the far-end Cloud Servers.

Using structural and tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we evaluated subcortical GM from patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy without visible lesion on MRI. Our aims were to determine whether there are structural abnormalities in these patients and to correlate the extent of any observed structural changes with clinical characteristics of disease in these patients.Methods: Twenty-four people with epilepsy and 29 age-matched normal subjects were imaged with high-resolution structural and diffusion tensor MR scans. The patients were characterised clinically by normal brain MRI scans and seizures that originated in the neocortex and evolved to secondarily generalised convulsions. We first used whole brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to detect density changes in subcortical GM. Volumetric data, values of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) for seven subcortical GM structures (hippocampus, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens, thalamus and amygdala) were obtained using a model-based segmentation and registration tool. Differences in the volumes and diffusion parameters between patients and controls and correlations with the early onset and progression of epilepsy were estimated.Results: Reduced volumes and altered diffusion parameters of subcortical GM were universally observed in patients in the subcortical regions studied. In the patient-control group comparison of VBM, the right putamen, bilateral nucleus accumbens and right caudate nucleus of epileptic patients exhibited a significantly decreased density Segregated volumetry and diffusion assessment of subcortical GM showed apparent atrophy of the left caudate nucleus, left amygdala and right putamen; reduced FA values for the bilateral nucleus accumbens; and elevated MD values for the left thalamus, right hippocampus and right globus pallidus A decreased volume of the nucleus accumbens consistently related to an early onset of disease. The duration of disease contributed to the shrinkage of the left thalamus.Conclusions: Patients with neocortical seizures and secondary generalisation had smaller volumes and microstructural anomalies in subcortical GM regions. Subcortical GM atrophy is relevant to the early onset and progression of epilepsy. ? 2014 Peng et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Diffusion tensor imaging; Neocortical epilepsy; Subcortical grey matter; Volumetry,"adolescent; adult; amygdaloid nucleus; article; brain atrophy; caudate nucleus; child; clinical article; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diffusion tensor imaging; disease duration; evaluation study; female; focal epilepsy; fractional anisotropy; globus pallidus; hippocampus; human; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; nucleus accumbens; putamen; thalamus; volumetry; voxel based morphometry; diffusion tensor imaging; epilepsy; gray matter; image processing; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; procedures; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Epilepsy; Female; Gray Matter; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84903783623

This study aims to clarify the association between bronchial asthma and the risk of developing chronic kidney disease.Methods: The National Health Research Institute provided a database of one million random subjects for the study. A random sample of 141 064 patients aged ?18 years without a history of kidney disease was obtained from the database. Among them, there were 35 086 with bronchial asthma and 105 258 without asthma matched for sex and age for a ration of 1:3. After adjusting for confounding risk factors, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the risk of developing chronic kidney disease during a three-year follow-up period.Results: Of the subjects with asthma, 2 196 (6.26%) developed chronic kidney disease compared to 4 120 (3.91%) of the control subjects. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that subjects with asthma were more likely to develop chronic kidney disease (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.48-1.64; p < 0.001). After adjusting for sex, age, monthly income, urbanization level, geographic region, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and steroid use, the HR for asthma patients was 1.40 (95% CI: 1.33-1.48; p = 0.040). There was decreased HRs in steroid use (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.62-0.61; p < 0.001) in the development of chronic kidney disease. Expectorants, bronchodilators, anti-muscarinic agents, airway smooth muscle relaxants, and leukotriene receptor antagonists may also be beneficial in attenuating the risk of chronic kidney disease.Conclusions: Patients with bronchial asthma may have increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease.

Myeloid progenitors express the fusion oncogene BCR-ABL, which has uncontrollable activity in malignant cells and prevents the cell apoptosis caused by some antineoplastic agents, such as paclitaxel. Targeting these abnormalities by blocking the tyrosine kinase enzymes of BCR-ABL is a promising approach for chronic myelogenous leukemia therapy. Main methods Conventional Liu's staining is an auxiliary technique used in microscopy to enhance the contrast in microscopic images, aiding the observation of cell morphology. The MTT assay, flow cytometry of the sub-G1 analysis and the TUNEL assay were applied to estimate the apoptosis levels. RT-PCR and western blot methods were used to evaluate the key molecules conferring anti-cell-death properties. Key findings The effects of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1024 were evaluated with regard to the regulation of BCR-ABL expression, inhibition of cell proliferation, and enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in BCR-ABL-expressing K562 cell lines. AG1024 downregulated the expression of BCR-ABL and anti-apoptosis factors, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which were present in K562 cells. Moreover, the combination of AG1024 with paclitaxel inhibited cell proliferation and enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis within 24 h. Significance In summary, the present study shows that the combination of AG1024 with paclitaxel inhibited model cancer cell proliferation, suggesting a new use of paclitaxel-based chemotherapy for cancer control. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",AG1024; Chemotherapy; Chronic myelogenous leukemia; Paclitaxel,"AG1024; Chemotherapy; Chronic myelogenous leukemia; Paclitaxel; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Apoptosis; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Therapy, Combination; Humans; K562 Cells; Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive; Paclitaxel; Tyrphostins; Up-Regulation",2-s2.0-84898801727

It is hence beneficial to have an integral means that can interrogate both cardiomyocytes in vitro and a heart in vivo. Herein we report an application of dual-beam optical reflectometry to determine noninvasively the rhythm of two representative cardiac models-chick embryonic cardiomyocytes and the heart of zebrafish. We probed selfbeating cardiomyocytes and revealed the temporally varying contractile frequency with a short-time Fourier transform. Our unique dual-beam setup uniquely records the atrial and ventricular pulsations of zebrafish simultaneously. To minimize the cross talk between signals associated with atrial and ventricular chambers, we particularly modulated the two probe beams at distinct frequencies and extracted the signals specific to individual cardiac chambers with phase-sensitive detection. With this setup, we determined the atrio-ventricular interval, a parameter that is manifested by the electrical conduction from the atrium to the ventricle. To demonstrate pharmacological applications, we characterized zebrafish treated with various cardioactive and cardiotoxic drugs, and identified abnormal cardiac rhythms and atrioventricular (AV) blocks of varied degree. In light of its potential capability to assess cardiac models both in vitro and in vivo and to screen drugs with cardioactivity or toxicity, we expect this approach to have broad applications ranging from cardiopharmacology to developmental biology. ?2014 Optical Society of America.",,Biology; Broad application; Cardiac chambers; Developmental biology; Electrical conduction; Optical reflectometry; Phase-sensitive detection; Potential capability; Short time Fourier transforms; Heart; adrenalin; digoxin; esmolol; isoflurane; tricaine; animal cell; animal tissue; article; atrioventricular block; atrioventricular conduction; chick embryo; dual beam optical reflectometry; heart fibrillation; heart muscle cell; heart rate; heart rhythm; heart ventricle tachycardia; histogram; model; nonhuman; reflectometry; zebra fish,2-s2.0-84899735409

For this study, we conducted a secondary analysis of data from a prospective cohort study of 351 patients aged 65 years and older. Participants were recruited from five surgical and medical wards at a tertiary medical center in northern Taiwan and assessed at three time points: within 48. h of admission, before discharge, and 6 months post-discharge. The course of depressive symptoms was dynamic with symptoms increased spontaneously and substantially during hospitalization and subsided at 6 months after discharge, but still remained higher than at admission. Overall, 26.7% of older patients at hospital discharge met established criteria for minor depression (15-item Geriatric Depressive Scale (GDS-15) scores 5-9) and 21.2% for major depression (GDS-15 scores >10). As the strongest associated factors, functional dependence and nutritional status influenced depressive symptoms following hospitalization. Depressive symptoms at discharge showed significant cross-lagged effects on functional dependence and nutritional status at 6 months after discharge, suggesting a reciprocal, triadic relationship. Thus, treating one condition might improve the other. Targeting the triad of depressive symptoms, functional dependence, and nutritional status, therefore, is essential for treating depressive symptoms and improving the overall health of older adults hospitalized for acute illness. ? 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Depressive symptoms; Functional status; Geriatric syndrome; Nutritional status; Older adults,"aged; article; cohort analysis; depression; disease course; female; functional assessment; Geriatric Depressive Scale; hospital discharge; hospitalization; human; interview; major clinical study; male; nutritional status; priority journal; prospective study; psychological rating scale; symptom; Taiwan; Depressive symptoms; Functional status; Geriatric syndrome; Nutritional status; Older adults; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Depression; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Geriatric Assessment; Hospitalization; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Nutritional Status; Patient Discharge; Prospective Studies; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Socioeconomic Factors; Taiwan",2-s2.0-84896717261

Nevertheless, biochemical analysis of the lipid profile in blood in vitro remains the most common way to evaluate the therapeutic effect of drugs targeting atherosclerosis because of an inherent difficulty to access the vascular wall. Using hypercholesterolemic zebrafish, we present an orchestrated application of Raman spectral measurements and confocal fluorescence imaging to interrogate the pharmacological response of atherosclerotic lesions in situ and in vivo. For demonstration, we investigated two commonly prescribed antihyperlipidemic drugs, ezetimibe and atorvastatin. The treatment of ezetimibe or atorvastatin alone decreased effectively the deposition of lipids in the vascular wall, and a combined dose showed a synergistic effect. Atorvastatin exerted a profound antioxidative effect on vascular fatty lesions. Analysis of individual lesions shows further that these lesions exhibited a heterogeneous response to the treatment of atorvastatin; a significant fraction of, but not all, the lesions became nonoxidized after the intervention. Beyond its efficacies in suppressing both the accumulation and oxidation of vascular lipids, atorvastatin expedited the clearance of vascular lipids. The possession of pleotropic (multiple) therapeutic effects on vascular fatty lesions of hypercholesterolemic zebrafish by atorvastatin is notably consistent with the known pharmaceutical effects of this drug on human beings. These results improve our understanding of the antiatherosclerotic effect of drugs. We envisage that our approach has the potential to become a platform to predict the pharmaceutical effects of new drugs aiming to cure human atherosclerotic diseases. ? 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"Fluorescence; Lipids; Antioxidative effects; Atherosclerotic lesions; Biochemical analysis; Confocal fluorescence imaging; Fluorescence imaging; Pharmacological response; Raman spectral measurements; Therapeutic effects; Diseases; atorvastatin; azetidine derivative; ezetimibe; heptanoic acid derivative; hypocholesterolemic agent; lipid; pyrrole derivative; animal; atherosclerosis; blood; blood vessel; confocal microscopy; drug effects; hypercholesterolemia; lipid metabolism; metabolism; pathology; Raman spectrometry; zebra fish; Animals; Anticholesteremic Agents; Atherosclerosis; Azetidines; Blood Vessels; Heptanoic Acids; Hypercholesterolemia; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Microscopy, Confocal; Pyrroles; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Zebrafish",2-s2.0-84898905836

As a model drug carrier, gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been investigated extensively for in vivo toxicity. The effect of GNPs on the immune system, however, has rarely been examined. Antibody-secreting cells were treated with GNPs with diameters ranging from 2 to 50 nm. The GNPs enhanced IgG secretion in a size-dependent manner, with a peak of efficacy at 10 nm. The immune-stimulatory effect reached a maximum at 12 h after treatment but returned to control levels 24 h after treatment. This enhancing effect was validated ex vivo using B-cells isolated from mouse spleen. Evidence from RT-PCR and western blot experiments indicates that GNP-treatment upregulated B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (blimp1) and downregulated paired box 5 (pax5). Immunostaining for blimp1 and pax5 in B-cells confirmed that the GNPs stimulated IgG secretion through the blimp1/pax5 pathway. The immunization of mice using peptide-conjugated GNPs indicated that the GNPs were capable of enhancing humoral immunity in a size-dependent manner. This effect was consistent with the bio-distribution of the GNPs in mouse spleen. In conclusion, in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo evidence supports our hypothesis that GNPs enhance humoral immunity in mouse. The effect on the immune system should be taken into account if nanoparticles are used as carriers for drug delivery. In addition to their toxicity, the immune-stimulatory activity of nanoparticles could play an important role in human health and could have an environmental impact. ? 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.",antibody secretion; Bcell; gold nanoparticle; immune system,"After-treatment; Bcell; Biodistributions; Enhancing effect; Gold Nanoparticles; Gold nanoparticles (GNPs); Humoral immunity; Potential threats; Balloons; Cells; Cytology; Drug delivery; Environmental impact; Gold; Health risks; Immune system; Mammals; Medical applications; Metal nanoparticles; Physiology; Antibodies; gold; metal nanoparticle; Pax5 protein, mouse; peptide; Prdm1 protein, mouse; transcription factor; transcription factor PAX5; virus antibody; animal; article; B lymphocyte; Bagg albino mouse; chemistry; drug effect; foot and mouth disease; Foot and mouth disease virus; genetics; immunology; metabolism; mouse; signal transduction; spleen; tumor cell line; virology; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; B-Cell-Specific Activator Protein; B-Lymphocytes; Cell Line, Tumor; Foot-and-Mouth Disease; Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus; Gold; Metal Nanoparticles; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Peptides; Signal Transduction; Spleen; Transcription Factors",2-s2.0-84896889781

Comorbidities, poor levels of activity and pain may contribute to the development of depression, but these factors have not been well addressed. This study aims to investigate the frequency and risk of major depression after a femoral neck fracture using a nationwide population-based study. The Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database was used in this study. A total of 4,547 patients who were hospitalized for femoral neck fracture within 2003 to 2007 were recruited as a study group; 13,641 matched non-fracture participants were enrolled as a comparison group. Each patient was prospectively followed for 3 years to monitor the occurrence of major depression. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to compute the risk of major depression between members of the study and comparison group after adjusting for residence and sociodemographic characteristics. The most common physical comorbidities that were present after the fracture were also analyzed. The incidences of major depression were 1.2% (n = 55) and 0.7% (n = 95) in the study and comparison groups, respectively. The stratified Cox proportional analysis showed a covariate-adjusted hazard ratio of major depression among patients with femoral neck fracture that was 1.82 times greater (95% CI, 1.30-2.53) than that of the comparison group. Most major depressive episodes (34.5%) presented within the first 200 days following the fracture. In conclusion, patients with a femoral neck fracture are at an increased risk of subsequent major depression. Most importantly, major depressive episodes mainly occurred within the first 200 days following the fracture. ? 2014 Chang et al.",,"adult; aged; article; cellulitis; cerebrovascular accident; chronic obstructive lung disease; comorbidity; controlled study; deep vein thrombosis; disease free survival; female; femur neck fracture; follow up; heart arrhythmia; heart failure; human; incidence; major clinical study; major depression; male; peptic ulcer; pneumonia; population research; Taiwan; adolescent; case control study; complication; Depressive Disorder, Major; factual database; femur neck fracture; hospitalization; longitudinal study; middle aged; proportional hazards model; prospective study; psychology; risk factor; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Case-Control Studies; Comorbidity; Databases, Factual; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Femoral Neck Fractures; Follow-Up Studies; Hospitalization; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84898738828

However, the molecular mechanism of tamoxifen-induced cytotoxicity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells has not been identified. Thymidine phosphorylase (TP) is an enzyme of the pyrimidine salvage pathway which is upregulated in cancers. In this study, tamoxifen treatment inhibited cell survival in two NSCLC cells, H520 and H1975. Treatment with tamoxifen decreased TP mRNA and protein levels through AKT inactivation. Furthermore, expression of constitutively active AKT (AKT-CA) vectors significantly rescued the decreased TP protein and mRNA levels in tamoxifen-treated NSCLC cells. In contrast, combination treatment with PI3K inhibitors (LY294002 or wortmannin) and tamoxifen further decreased the TP expression and cell viability of NSCLC cells. Knocking down TP expression by transfection with small interfering RNA of TP enhanced the cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition of tamoxifen. Erlotinib (Tarceva, OSI-774), an orally available small molecular inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, is approved for clinical treatment of NSCLC. Compared to a single agent alone, tamoxifen combined with erlotinib resulted in cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition synergistically in NSCLC cells, accompanied with reduced activation of phospho-AKT and phospho-ERK1/2, and reduced TP protein levels. These findings may have implications for the rational design of future drug regimens incorporating tamoxifen and erlotinib for the treatment of NSCLC. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",AKT; ERK1/2; Erlotinib; Non-small-cell lung cancer; Tamoxifen; Thymidine phosphorylase,"2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone; erlotinib; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 1; protein kinase B; small interfering RNA; tamoxifen; thymidine phosphorylase; wortmannin; 2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone; protein kinase B; small interfering RNA; tamoxifen; thymidine phosphorylase; wortmannin; article; cancer cell; cancer inhibition; cell growth; cell proliferation; cell survival; cell viability; controlled study; down regulation; drug cytotoxicity; drug potentiation; enzyme inactivation; gene silencing; genetic transfection; human; human cell; lung non small cell cancer; priority journal; protein expression; Article; cancer survival; cytotoxicity; down regulation; drug approval; drug potentiation; enzyme activation; H1975 cell line; H520 cell line; lung cancer cell line; non small cell lung cancer; protein expression; Actinomycin D (PubChem CID: 2019); AKT; Crystal violet (PubChem CID: 11057); Cycloheximide (PubChem CID: 6197); ERK1/2; Erlotinib; Erlotinib (PubChem CID: 176870); l-glutamine (PubChem CID: 5961); LY294002 (PubChem CID: 3973); Non-small-cell lung cancer; Penicillin (PubChem CID: 5904); Sodium bicarbonate (PubChem CID: 516892); Streptomycin (PubChem CID: 19649); Tamoxifen; Tamoxifen (PubChem CID: 2733526); Thymidine phosphorylase; Trypan blue (PubChem CID: 9562061); U0126 (PubChem CID: 3006531); Wortmannin (PubChem CID: 312145); Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Synergism; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Quinazolines; Tamoxifen; Thymidine Phosphorylase; Time Factors",2-s2.0-84896728567

Data were drawn from surveys with 108 older Chinese Americans living in the Tampa and Orlando areas of Florida (M age = 70.6 years, SD = 7.70). Results from hierarchical regression analysis suggest the importance of chronic health conditions and functional status as correlates of depressive symptoms. In addition, high levels of sense of mastery and acculturation were also found to be significant. Findings highlight the importance of psychosocial and cultural factors and suggest that such factors need to be considered in efforts to promote the mental health of ethnic minority older adults.

We tested a single domain antibody (sdAb) targeting CEACAM6, 2A3, which was isolated previously from a llama immune library, and an Fc conjugated version of this sdAb, to determine how they affect the pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC3. We also compared the effects of the antibodies to gemcitabine. Gemcitabine and 2A3 slowed down cancer cell proliferation. However, only 2A3 retarded cancer cell invasion, angiogenesis within the cancer mass and BxPC3 cell MMP-9 activity, three features important for tumour growth and metastasis. The IC50s for 2A3, 2A3-Fc and gemcitabine were determined as 6.5 μM, 8 μM and 12 nM, respectively. While the 2A3 antibody inhibited MMP-9 activity by 33% compared to non-treated control cells, gemcitabine failed to inhibit MMP-9 activity. Moreover, 2A3 and 2A3-Fc inhibited invasion of BxPC3 by 73% compared to non-treated cells. When conditioned media that were produced using 2A3- or 2A3-Fc-treated BxPC3 cells were used in a capillary formation assay, the capillary length was reduced by 21% and 49%, respectively. Therefore 2A3 is an ideal candidate for treating tumours that over-express CEACAM6. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We report a proof-of-principle study to demonstrate the utility of zebrafish as an analytical platform to predict the cardiac response of new drugs or chemicals on human beings. With pseudodynamic 3D imaging, we derive individual parameters that are central to the cardiac function of zebrafish, including the ventricular stroke volume, ejection fraction, cardiac output, heart rate, diastolic filling function, and ventricular mass. We evaluate both inotropic and chronotropic responses of the heart of zebrafish treated with drugs that are commonly prescribed and possess varied known cardiac activities. We reveal deranged cardiac function of a zebrafish model of cardiomyopathy induced with a cardiotoxic drug. The cardiac function of zebrafish exhibits a pharmacological response similar to that of human beings. We compare also cardiac parameters obtained in this work with those derived with conventional 2D approximation and show that the latter tends to overestimate the cardiac parameters and produces results of greater variation.

While the analysis of enzyme activity remains the diagnostic test of choice for individuals with Pompe disease, mutation analysis remains for establishing a definitive diagnosis. Methods: High resolution melting (HRM) analysis was performed to screen GAA mutations. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of the two patients with Pompe disease and 250 normal controls. Exons 2 through 20 of the GAA gene were screened by the HRM analysis. The results were subsequently confirmed by direct sequencing. Results: This assay proved to be feasible in detecting seven known (c.2T>C, c.1726G>A, c.1845G>A, c.1935C>A, c.1958C>A, c.2238G>C, and c.2815_2816del) GAA mutations. Each mutation could be readily and accurately identified in the difference plot curves. We estimated the carrier frequency of the most common mutation, c.1935G>A (p.D645E), in the Taiwanese population to be 0.2%. Conclusions: In clinical practice, we suggest that HRM analysis is assumed as a fast and reliable method for screening GAA gene mutations especially the most common mutations which are responsible for Pompe disease among the Taiwanese populations. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Acid α-glucosidase (GAA) gene; High resolution melting; Mutation analysis; Pompe disease,"creatine kinase; genomic DNA; glucan 1,4 alpha glucosidase; phosphatase; acid alpha glucosidase gene; article; blood sampling; case report; child; controlled study; DNA extraction; enzyme activity; female; gene frequency; gene mutation; glycogen storage disease type 2; high resolution melting analysis; human; human tissue; male; muscle biopsy; mutational analysis; preschool child; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; school child; sequence analysis; acid α-glucosidase; Acid α-glucosidase (GAA) gene; DBS; denaturing high performance liquid chromatography; DHPLC; dried blood spot; GAA; High resolution melting; high resolution melting; HRM; Mutation analysis; PCR; polymerase chain reaction; Pompe disease; WCN; weighted contact number; alpha-Glucosidases; Base Sequence; Child; Child, Preschool; Conserved Sequence; DNA Mutational Analysis; Feasibility Studies; Female; Gene Frequency; Glycogen Storage Disease Type II; Humans; Male; Nucleic Acid Denaturation; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Transition Temperature",2-s2.0-84888406640

The pitch-based VAD is developed on ANSI S1.11 based filter bank architecture and employs the characteristics of monosyllable and nonlinear energy operator (NEO) to improve the accuracy of VAD. The neuromorphic noise attenuator reduces the background noise by using the characteristics of human hearing system and the clues of speech. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has better SNR and PESQ performance than other non-pitch based NR algorithms in non-stationary background noise environments. Compared with multiband (mband) spectral subtraction and minimum mean square error (mmse) algorithms, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm can save 90% computational complexity.

Genome-wide association (GWA) studies for adiponectin levels have identified 14 loci harboring variants associated with blood levels of adiponectin. To identify novel adiponectin-associated loci, particularly those of importance in East Asians, we conducted a meta-analysis of GWA studies for adiponectin in 7827 individuals, followed by two stages of replications in 4298 and 5954 additional individuals. We identified a novel adiponectin-associated locus on chromosome 10 near WDR11-FGFR2 (P = 3.0 × 10-14) and provided suggestive evidence for a locus on chromosome 12 near OR8S1-LALBA (P = 1.2 × 10-7). Of the adiponectinassociated loci previously described, we confirmed the association at CDH13 (P = 6.8 × 10-165), ADIPOQ (P = 1.8 × 10-22), PEPD (P = 3.6 × 10-12), CMIP (P = 2.1 × 10-10), ZNF664 (P = 2.3 × 10-7) and GPR109A (P = 7.4 × 10-6). Conditional analysis at ADIPOQ revealed a second signal with suggestive evidence of association only after conditioning on the lead SNP (Pinitial = 0.020; Pconditional = 7.0 × 10-7). We further confirmed the independence of two pairs of closely located loci (&lt;2 Mb) on chromosome 16 at CMIP and CDH13, and on chromosome 12 at GPR109A and ZNF664. In addition, the newly identified signal near WDR11-FGFR2 exhibited evidence of association with triglycerides (P = 3.3 × 10-4), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, P = 4.9 × 10-4) and body mass index (BMI)-adjusted waist-hip ratio (P = 9.8 × 10-3). These findings improve our knowledge of the genetic basis of adiponectin variation, demonstrate the shared allelic architecture for adiponectin with lipids and central obesity and motivate further studies of underlying mechanisms. ?

KRAS mutations in codon 12 and 13 are recognized biomarkers that are analyzed in clinic previously for anti-EGFR therapies administration. Since originally mutations in both codons were considered as a predictor of lack of response to cetuximab or panitumumab, the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration suggested that patients harboring any of those mutations should be excluded from the treatment. However, subsequent retrospective analysis has shown that mutations in codon 12 and codon 13 of KRAS gene could be different in their biological characteristics and as a result could confer variable effects in patients. In addition and increasing and sometimes contradictory number of solutions have been published demonstrating that patients with mutations in codon 13 could have worse outcome but could obtain a significant clinical benefit from anti-EGFR therapies.

We previously reported that andrographolide suppressed v-Src-mediated cellular transformation by promoting the degradation of Src. In the present study, we demonstrated the involvement of Hsp90 in the andrographolide-mediated inhibition of Src oncogenic activity. Using a proteomics approach, a cleavage fragment of Hsp90α was identified in andrographolide-treated cells. The concentration- and time-dependent induction of Hsp90 cleavage that accompanied the reduction in Src was validated in RK3E cells transformed with either v-Src or a human truncated c-Src variant and treated with andrographolide. In cancer cells, the induction of Hsp90 cleavage by andrographolide and its structural derivatives correlated well with decreased Src levels, the suppression of transformation, and the induction of apoptosis. Moreover, the andrographolide-induced Hsp90 cleavage, Src degradation, inhibition of transformation, and induction of apoptosis were abolished by a ROS inhibitor, N-acetyl-cysteine. Notably, Hsp90 cleavage, decreased levels of Bcr-Abl (another known Hsp90 client protein), and the induction of apoptosis were also observed in human K562 leukemia cells treated with andrographolide or its active derivatives. Together, we demonstrated a novel mechanism by which andrographolide suppressed cancer malignancy that involved inhibiting Hsp90 function and reducing the levels of Hsp90 client proteins.

Despite the availability of many methods to identify bacteria, most of them are only applicable to specific and cultivable bacteria and are also tedious. Based on high throughput sequencing technology, this work derives 16S rRNA sequences of bacteria and analyzes probiotics and pathogens species.Results: We constructed a database that recorded the species of probiotics and pathogens from literature, along with a modified Smith-Waterman algorithm for assigning the taxonomy of the sequenced 16S rRNA sequences. We also constructed a bacteria disease risk model for seven diseases based on 98 samples. Applicability of the proposed platform is demonstrated by collecting the microbiome in human gut of 13 samples.Conclusions: The proposed platform provides a relatively easy means of identifying a certain amount of bacteria and their species (including uncultivable pathogens) for clinical microbiology applications. That is, detecting how probiotics and pathogens inhabit humans and how affect their health can significantly contribute to develop a diagnosis and treatment method. ? 2014 Chiu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,2-s2.0-84896342409

Nonetheless, the influence of ZDW on acute kidney injury is still unknown. We intended to identify the influence of ZDW on cell growth and gentamicin-induced apoptotic injury in renal tubular cells. Materials and methods We extracted ZDW with artificial intestinal fluid and treated rat renal tubular cells (NRK-52E) with various concentrations of the ZDW extraction. Cell proliferation and gentamicin-induced apoptosis of NRK-52E cells were evaluated using real-time proliferation monitoring and annexin V staining, respectively. Western blotting was used to evaluate the levels of Bcl-2 and caspase-3 expression. The effect of ZDW on gentamicin-induced kidney injury was also monitored in mice using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and the measurement of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. Results We found that 30 μg/ml of ZDW promoted cell proliferation of the rat renal tubular cells. ZDW also expressed a dose-dependent protective effect against gentamicin-induced apoptosis in the cells. Pretreatment with 3 μg/ml or 30 μg/ml of ZDW maximally increased Bcl-2 and decreased cleaved caspase-3 in the gentamicin-treated NRK-52E cells. Among the herbal ingredients of ZDW, only Phellodendron amurense Rupr., bark (Cortex Phellodendri), and Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge, rhizome inhibited both the gentamicin-induced Bcl-2 decrease and cleaved caspase-3 increase. Phellodendron amurense Rupr., bark and Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge, rhizome also inhibited gentamicin-induced apoptosis at particular concentrations; however, these two ingredients were less effective than ZDW. In the mouse model of gentamicin-induced nephropathy, the ZDW treatment significantly reduced apoptotic cells in the renal cortex and improved renal function. Conclusions Our results suggest that ZDW at adequate doses attenuates gentamicin-induced apoptotic injury in renal tubular cells and also protects kidneys from gentamicin-induced injury in mice. ? 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Acute kidney disease; Apoptosis; Gentamicin; Renal tubular cell; Zhibai Dihuang Wan,"Alisma aquatica extract; Anemarrhena asphodeloides extract; caspase 3; Cornus officinalis extract; creatinine; Dioscorea oppositifolia extract; gentamicin; herbaceous agent; lipocortin 5; Paeonia suffruticosa extract; Phellodendron amurense extract; plant extract; Poria cocos extract; protein bcl 2; Rehmannia glutinosa extract; unclassified drug; zhibai dihuang wan; Alisma; Alisma aquatica; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; article; bark; cell count; cell growth; cell proliferation; cell protection; concentration response; controlled study; creatinine blood level; Dioscorea oppositifolia; dose response; drug effect; drug megadose; intestine fluid; kidney cortex; kidney function; kidney injury; kidney tubule cell; low drug dose; male; mouse; nick end labeling; nonhuman; plant root; protein cleavage; protein expression; rat; renal protection; rhizome; urea nitrogen blood level; Western blotting; yam; Anemarrhena asphodeloides; Mus; Phellodendron amurense; Rattus; Acute kidney disease; Apoptosis; Fluorescein isothiocyanate (Pubchem CID: 18730); Gentamicin; Gentamicin (Pubchem CID:3467); Methanol (Pubchem CID: 887); Pentobarbital (Pubchem CID: 4737); Potassium dihydrogen phosphate (Pubchem CID: 516951); Propidium iodide (Pubchem CID: 104981); Renal tubular cell; Zhibai Dihuang Wan; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Line; Cell Proliferation; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Gene Expression Regulation; Gentamicins; Kidney Diseases; Kidney Tubules; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Protein Synthesis Inhibitors; Rats",2-s2.0-84891484674

BPR1J-340 inhibited the phosphorylation of FLT3 and STAT5 and triggered apoptosis in FLT3-ITD + AML cells. The pharmacokinetic parameters of BPR1J-340 in rats were determined. BPR1J-340 also demonstrated pronounced tumor growth inhibition and regression in FLT3-ITD+ AML murine xenograft models. The combination treatment of the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat (SAHA) with BPR1J-340 synergistically induced apoptosis via Mcl-1 down-regulation in MOLM-13 AML cells, indicating that the combination of selective FLT3 kinase inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors could exhibit clinical benefit in AML therapy.

Endothelin 1 (Edn1) has been identified as a gene that is significantly up-regulated in HBx-induced HCC in mice. In this study, we further investigated the role of edn1 in hepatocarcinogenesis using a transgenic zebrafish model and a cell culture system. Liver-specific edn1 expression caused steatosis, fibrosis, glycogen accumulation, bile duct dilation, hyperplasia, and HCC in zebrafish. Overexpression of EDN1 in 293T cells enhanced cell proliferation and cell migration in in vitro and xenotransplantation assays and was accompanied with up-regulation of several cell cycle/proliferation- and migration-specific genes. Furthermore, expression of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathwayrelated mediators, such as spliced XBP1, ATF6, IRE1, and PERK, was also up-regulated at both the RNA and protein levels. In the presence of an EDN1 inhibitor or an AKT inhibitor, these increases were diminished and the EDN1-induced migration ability also was disappeared, suggesting that the EDN1 effects act through activation of the AKT pathway to enhance the UPR and subsequently activate the expression of downstream genes. Additionally, p-AKT is enhanced in the edn1 transgenic fish compared to the GFP-mCherry control. The micro RNA miR-1 was found to inhibit the expression of EDN1. We also observed an inverse correlation between EDN1 and miR-1 expression in HCC patients. In conclusion, our data suggest that EDN1 plays an important role in HCC progression by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway and is regulated by miR-1. ? 2014 Lu et al.",,"activating transcription factor 6; endothelin 1; fluorescent dye; glycogen; mCherry; microRNA 1; protein IRE1; protein kinase; protein kinase B; protein PERK; RNA; unclassified drug; X box binding protein 1; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bile duct dilatation; cancer growth; cancer patient; cell culture; cell migration; cell proliferation; controlled study; embryo; fatty liver; gene expression regulation; glycogen metabolism; in vitro study; liver cancer; liver carcinogenesis; liver fibrosis; liver hyperplasia; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; protein analysis; protein expression; protein function; RNA splicing; signal transduction; tissue specificity; transgenic animal; unfolded protein response; upregulation; xenotransplantation; zebra fish; Animals; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Cycle; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Endothelin-1; Fatty Liver; Gene Expression; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Neoplasms; MicroRNAs; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Unfolded Protein Response; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins",2-s2.0-84896916006

The surgical techniques traditionally vary with the anatomic extent of the aortic dissection. Simple ascending aortic grafting can be lifesaving, but the lesions beyond the aorta, which include the arch vessels and descending aorta, remain potential hazards. In this paper, we present a patient in which acute type A aortic dissection with lesions extending into descending thoracic aorta was successfully managed by total arch replacement with supra-aortic transposition plus the frozen elephant trunk technique to the descending aorta. A 67-year-old gentleman presented with severe tearing pain from the anterior to posterior chest. Computed tomography confirmed the diagnosis of acute type A dissection extending to the level of the right common iliac artery. An emergent operation was performed as in the aforementioned technique. The surgery went well and the patient was discharged without comorbidities on postoperative day 25. The patient had regular outpatient clinical follow-up. The follow-up computed tomography images showed adequate results with the obliteration of the false lumen. In conclusion, total aortic arch replacement with supra-aortic transposition plus frozen elephant trunk technique is a safe and feasible operative method for patients with detrimental acute type A aortic dissection.

The identification of the link between the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway has led to development of the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib. The introduction of sunitinib in clinical practice for the treatment of metastatic RCC has significantly increased the overall survival of patients. However resistance to sunitinib is emerging as a challenge. About 30% of patients are intrinsically resistant to sunitinib and almost all patients who show initial response to sunitinib develop extrinsic (acquired) resistance after a median of 6-15 months. While the molecular mechanisms of sunitinib resistance are multifactorial, the emerging consensus is that, sustained VEGF/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) inhibition by sunitinib 'resets' the tumor microenvironment leading to the development of VEGF/VEGFRindependent alternate angiogenic pathways. This chapter summarises the advances in understanding of the molecular mechanisms of sunitinib resistance in RCC. ? 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

But IOP is not easy and consistence to be measured under different measure conditions. Besides, diabetes is associated with diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN). Pupil size response might provide an indirect means about neuronal pathways, so the abnormal pupil size may relate with DAN. Hence an infrared videopupillography is needed for tracking glaucoma and exploring the relation between pupil size and DAN. Our previous research proposed an infrared videopupillography to monitoring the pupil size of different light stimulus in dark room. And this portable infrared videopupillography contains a camera, a beam splitter, the visible-light LEDs for stimulating the eyes, and the infrared LEDs for lighting the eyes. It can be mounted on any eyeglass frame. But it can modulate only two dimensions, we cannot zoom in/out the eyes. Moreover, the eye diameter curves were not smooth and jagged because of the light spots, lone eyelashes, and blink. Therefore, we redesign the optical path of our device to have three dimension modulation. Then we can zoom in the eye to increase the eye resolution and to avoid the LED light spots. The light spot could be solved by defining the distance between IR LED and CCD. This device smaller volume and less prices of our previous videopupillography.

The more precise the position of an anchor node is, the more accurate the localization of a sensor node can be measured. Since the Global Positioning System (GPS) device cannot work properly indoor, some existing localization methods configure anchor nodes in a manual fashion. However, neither applying GPS modules nor manually configuring anchor nodes is suitable for a WSN and especially artificial errors of manual configuration may be propagated and affect the results of localization. In this paper, we propose an alternative method to estimate anchor node locations in an indoor environment. We collect the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data from the anchor node when human is walking around them. Meanwhile, we use a wearable IMU-camera device to assist the moving trajectory estimation. We implement a monocular Visual Odometry with a human walking model to estimate moving trajectories. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is used to estimate the anchor node location by fusing the RSSI data and moving trajectory. The experiment results show that the proposed method has lower estimation error when locating anchors. ? 2014 Jwu-Sheng Hu et al.",,Cameras; Global positioning system; Indoor positioning systems; Location; Sensor nodes; Trajectories; Wearable sensors; Wearable technology; Indoor environment; Landslide detection; Localization method; Modern applications; Precision Agriculture; Received signal strength indicators; Trajectory estimation; Unscented Kalman Filter; Wireless sensor networks,2-s2.0-84934887982

The vibrations of skin surface and the sensor module are successfully simulated by the established FEM. The resulted vibratory deformation of the sensor electrodes are further transformed to resistance variations to mimic realistic electronics of the front-end readout circuit via establishing a cross-discipline sub-FEM model.

A complete 3D biomechanical analysis of the locomotor system was performed on these data. The results showed that with increasing downhill angles young healthy adults increased the posterior tilt of the pelvis and lateral trunk bending towards the stance limb, as well as the peak dorsiflexor and extensor moments at the ankle and knee, respectively, during the first half of the stance phase (SP), and increased the peak moments at the hip during the second half of the SP. The associated joint forces also varied with increasing slopes over the SP. When the overall mechanical demands were considered over the SP, the angular extensor and plantarflexor impulses at the knee and ankle were found to increase linearly with increasing slopes.

For the user who had only implanted one CI in unilateral ear, combined a hearing aid (HA) in contralateral ear, known as bimodal hearing, can improved the speech perception. This is partly true due to the residual low frequency acoustic information provided from HA can help CI users to segregate the target speech from noise. In this study, a vocoder was conducted to evaluate the effect of low frequency information, especially the fundamental frequency (F0), in recognizing Taiwanese Mandarin for bimodal CI users. The result showed that F0 was the main factor in low frequency acoustic information, and bimodal apparently enhance the performance of speech recognition in noise in Taiwanese Mandarin. ?

Severe fatty liver is sometimes accompanied by steatohepatitis and may lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. At present, there is no effective treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); thus, recent investigations have focused on developing effective therapeutics to treat this condition. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of kefir on the hepatic lipid metabolism of ob/ob mice, which are commonly used to model fatty liver disease.Results:In this study, we used leptin receptor-deficient ob/ob mice as an animal disease model of NAFLD. Six-week-old ob/ob mice were orally administered the dairy product kefir (140 mg kg-1 of body weight (BW) per day) for 4 weeks. The data demonstrated that kefir improved fatty liver syndrome on BW, energy expenditure and basal metabolic rate by inhibiting serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) activities (P<0.05) and by decreasing the triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) contents of the liver (P<0.05). Oral kefir administration also significantly reduced the macrovesicular fat quantity in liver tissue. In addition, kefir markedly decreased the expression of the genes sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (P<0.05) but not the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) or hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1α (CPT1α) in the livers of ob/ob mice.Conclusion:On the basis of these results, we conclude that kefir improves NAFLD on BW, energy expenditure and basal metabolic rate by inhibiting the lipogenesis pathway and that kefir may have the potential for clinical application to the prevention or treatment of NAFLD. ? 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",kefir; leptin-deficient ob/ob mice; lipid oxidative pathway; lipogenesis pathway; non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,"acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I alpha; fatty acid synthase; kefir; leptin; leptin receptor; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; unclassified drug; biological marker; leptin receptor; Srebf1 protein, mouse; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; alanine aminotransferase blood level; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; basal metabolic rate; body composition; body weight; controlled study; drug mechanism; energy expenditure; fatty liver; gene expression; hepatomegaly; lipid oxidation; lipogenesis; liver function; liver injury; liver weight; mouse; nonhuman; ob/ob mouse; priority journal; animal; dairy product; deficiency; diet therapy; disease model; energy metabolism; gene expression regulation; knockout mouse; lipid metabolism; liver; metabolism; mouse mutant; nonalcoholic fatty liver; organ size; pathophysiology; signal transduction; Western blotting; Animalia; Mus; Animals; Basal Metabolism; Biological Markers; Blotting, Western; Cultured Milk Products; Disease Models, Animal; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Obese; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Organ Size; Receptors, Leptin; Signal Transduction; Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1",2-s2.0-84927019052

Application of 5-DTAN prior to each TPA-treatment was more effective than that of TAN on reducing the number, incidence and size of papillomas in DMBA-initiated mouse skin. Moreover, 5-DTAN suppressed cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein expression more strongly than TAN through interfering with phosphatidylinositiol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling and further activation of transcription factor NF-κB. Taken together, these results revealed for the first time the in vivo chemopreventive efficacy of 5-DTAN on inhibition of skin carcinogenesis through promoting apoptosis and molecular interactions with residues of PI3K, COX-2, and AKT that may potentially serve as a novel functional agent capable of preventing inflammation-associated tumorigenesis. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",5-Demethyltangeretin; DMBA; Inflammation; Tangeretin; TPA,Citrus,2-s2.0-84926421206

Methods: We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database and enrolled patients who underwent maintenance dialysis between 2000 and 2007. Annual incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage in patients receiving dialysis from 2000 to 2007 was determined. To identify predictors of hemorrhagic stroke, we used logistic regression model to estimate the relative ratio of factors for intracerebral hemorrhage in the most recent cohort (2007). The cumulative survival rate and comorbid conditions associated with mortality after intracerebral hemorrhage among all dialysis patients between 2000 and 2007 was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis. Results: We identified 57,261 patients on maintenance dialysis in the cohort of 2007, and 340 patients had history of intracerebral hemorrhage among them. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity of dialysis patients. The incidence rate of intracerebral hemorrhage among dialysis patients was about 0.6%. Adjusted logistic regression model showed that male gender, middle age (45-64 years), hypertension, and previous history of stroke were the independent predictors for the occurrence of intracerebral hemorrhage among chronic dialysis patients. 1,939 dialysis patients with development of intracerebral hemorrhage in the analysis period from 2000 to 2007 were identified. In-hospital mortality was high (36.15%) following intracerebral hemorrhage. They were followed up after intracerebral hemorrhage for a mean time of 41.56 months. Adjusted Cox regression analyses demonstrated that the factors independently associated with mortality after intracerebral hemorrhage among dialysis patients included diabetes mellitus, malignancy and a history of prior stroke. Conclusions: Dialysis patients who have history of prior stroke, diabetes and malignancy have worse survival than patients without these comorbidities. Attention must focus on providing optimal medical care after hemorrhagic stroke for these target groups to reduce mortality. ? 2014 Lin et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Comorbidity; Dialysis; Intracerebral hemorrhage; Mortality,"adult; aged; Article; brain hemorrhage; cerebrovascular accident; cohort analysis; comorbidity; data base; diabetes mellitus; disease association; disease course; female; follow up; hemodialysis patient; human; hypertension; incidence; major clinical study; male; mortality; national health insurance; outcome assessment; predictor variable; survival rate; Taiwan; brain hemorrhage; comorbidity; diabetes mellitus; health survey; International Classification of Diseases; Kaplan Meier method; Kidney Failure, Chronic; middle aged; proportional hazards model; recurrent disease; renal replacement therapy; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; survival rate; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Comorbidity; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Health Surveys; Hospital Mortality; Humans; International Classification of Diseases; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Recurrence; Renal Dialysis; Risk Factors; Survival Rate; Taiwan",2-s2.0-84923916586

Like all different kinds of immunoassays, both sensitivity and specificity are universally the most important key points of concern. In this study, we developed various approaches toward ultrahigh sensitivity in LC-based immunoassays for potential clinical applications. The LC-based immunodetection technique was demonstrated with the cancer biomarker CA125, which is a mucin-like glycoprotein commonly present in the serum of patients with ovarian and other types of cancer. By using LCs with larger birefringence, such as HDN, the sensitivity of immunodetection was drastically enhanced compared to 5CB, which has a relatively lower birefringence and is commonly used in LC biosensing studies. In addition, UV modification of the monolayer of dimethyloctadecyl[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ammonium chloride (DMOAP), which functions as the alignment layer for LCs, is suggested to increase functional groups suitable for covalent binding of biomolecules, stabilizing the immobilized anti-CA125 antibody and the immunocomplex thus formed, and contributing to the lowered detection limit. Finally, we show that it is possible to directly identify the formation of CA125 immunocomplex with HDN in a mixture of antigen and antibody without the need to eliminate unbound or unreacted biomolecules through washing, thereby creating a simplified procedure for faster LC-based immunoassay. It is evident from our results that label-free immunodetection based on birefringent LCs represents a novel biosensing technique with potentials to detect a wide range of biomolecules, providing an alternative to conventional label-based immunoassays. ? 2014 SPIE.",Alignment layers; Biosensors; Cancer biomarker; Immunodetection; Liquid crystals; Surface modification,Antibodies; Antigens; Biomolecules; Biosensors; Birefringence; Chemical detection; Chlorine compounds; Diseases; Functional groups; Liquid crystals; Molecular biology; Surface treatment; Alignment layers; Biosensing technique; Cancer biomarkers; Collective properties; Immunodetection; Liquid crystals (LCs); Sensitivity and specificity; Ultra-high-sensitivity; Liquids,2-s2.0-84922798135

In this study, a new system was designed to provide a platform for direct communication between dentists and patients. Methods: A new mobile app, Dental Calendar, combined with cloud services specific for dental care was created by a team constituted by dentists, computer scientists, and service scientists. This new system would remind patients about every scheduled appointment, and help them take pictures of their own oral cavity parts that require dental treatment and send them to dentists along with a symptom description. Dentists, by contrast, could confirm or change appointments easily and provide professional advice to their patients immediately. In this study, 26 dentists and 32 patients were evaluated by a questionnaire containing eight dental-service items before and after using this system. Paired sample t test was used for statistical analysis. Results: After using the Dental Calendar combined with cloud services, dentists were able to improve appointment arrangements significantly, taking care of the patients with sudden worse prosthesis (p<0.05). Patients also achieved significant improvement in appointment reminder systems, rearrangement of appointments in case of sudden worse prosthesis, and establishment of a direct relationship with dentists (p<0.05).

Osteoporosis markedly increases the risk of fractures, and further morbidity and mortality. Calcium is a major constituent of the bone and vitamin D helps maintain calcium homeostasis. Calcium and vitamin D supplements have long been recognized as the cornerstones for prevention and management of osteoporosis and fractures. Although the associations between calcium and vitamin D supplementation and bone mineral density, fracture prevention, and potential adverse outcomes from available evidence are inconsistent, the Institute of Medicine Committee and the American Geriatrics Society support a key role of calcium and vitamin D in skeletal health. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that calcium with or without vitamin D supplementation increases the risk of cardiovascular events and cancer. Older adults should obtain at least 1000 IU/day of vitamin D with 1000-1200 mg/day of calcium to reduce the risk of fractures.

We carried out a systematic review of published miRNA profiling studies that compared the miRNA expression profiles between GC tissues and paired noncancerous gastric tissue. A vote-counting strategy was followed with the collection of information like total number of studies reporting differential expression of miRNA, total number of tissue samples used in the studies, direction of differential expression and fold change. A total of 352 differentially expressed microRNAs were reported in the 14 microRNA expression profiling studies that compared GC tissues with normal tissues with 120 microRNAs reported at least in two studies. In the group of consistently reported microRNAs, miR-21 was reported upregulated in 10 studies followed by miR-25, miR-92, and miR-223 upregulated in eight studies. MiR-375 and miR-148a were found downregulated in six and five studies, respectively, followed by miR-638 in four studies.

In those systems, most of the restaurant information such as restaurant name, address, phone number, and introduction are collected manually. In this paper, we propose a restaurant information extraction method which can automatically extract restaurant information from online reviews of restaurants in blogs. In addition, by calculating TFIDFs of words in blog posts, the hot keywords can be discovered and ranked. For restaurant search, users are allowed to search by keywords, areas, and/or extracted hot keywords. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve over 90% average accuracy of hot keyword extraction and about 95% mean average precision for restaurant search. In user study, the fact that the proposed system is more useful than Google search in restaurant search is presented. ?

Previous studies considered the team formation problem with a leader and proposed efficient algorithms to address the problem. However, for large projects, a single leader is not capable of managing a team with a large number of team members. Thus, a number of leaders would be formed and organized into a hierarchy where each leader is responsible for only a limited number of team members. In this paper, we propose the team formation problem with the communication load constraint in social networks. The communication load constraint limits the number of team members a leader communicates with. To solve the problem, we design a two-phase framework. Based on the proposed framework, we first propose algorithm Opt to find an optimal team, under the communication load constraint, with minimal communication cost. For large social networks, we also propose algorithm Approx to find a nearly-optimal team. Experimental results show that algorithm Opt is able to find optimal teams and is more efficient than the brute-force algorithm. In addition, when nearlyoptimal teams are acceptable, algorithm Approx is much more scalable than algorithm Opt for large social networks. ?

Users are able to obtain the various location-based services by uploading their trajectories. In this paper, we address that a user’s movement behavior is able to discover by their similar shape trajectories and resulted in some regions frequently stay in common, called relevant stay regions. Once a set of stay regions discovered, we can predict the next region where the user intends to go and provide location-based information of the next stay in advance, such as traffic status, targeted advertises, sightseeing recommendations, and so on. Prior works have elaborated on discovering stay region from the whole crowd trajectories and then exploring the relations between the regions to describe the movement patterns for location prediction. However, the trajectories pass the same region may not have the similar movement behavior. Thus, we propose a framework to discover stay regions relevant to the specific movement behavior and then applied in location prediction, called Region Modeling and Mobility Prediction. The proposed framework includes two modules: region modeling and mobility prediction. In the region modeling module, we develop shape clustering method to group the similar trajectories from historical data and then explore the stay region model from trajectory clusters. Based on the discovered region model, the mobility prediction module provide a cluster selection algorithm and several prediction strategies to generate the topk relevant stay regions. Experiments results on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed model on detecting next stay region, comparing with other baseline methods. ?

Many apps utilize user contexts to provide innovative services, e.g., pedometer, advanced navigation and location based services. Two of the most important user contexts are mobility patterns (still and walk) and device wearing positions (hand, arm, chest, waist and thigh). We call these two user contexts “wearing behavior”. In this paper, we propose a 3-stage framework to recognize smartphone wearing behaviors by utilizing sensor data from smartphones. The framework starts with data preprocessing to extract sensor features and generate ground truths. After the data preprocessing, a threshold based finite state machine utilizes the sensor features to determine whether the smartphone is attached or not. Finally, a decision tree model is built based on the ground truth to determine the wearing behaviors. The experiment results show that our approach can achieve 94% accuracy in average. ?

Such an assistant make users life more convenient and help them prevent from unnecessary interferences. In conventional research, the activity inference problem is considered a classification instance, so in this paper we propose an association-based classifier framework (ACF) that aims at exploring the correlation among collected sensor data. Each data consists of multiple sensor readings with a label, e.g., dining, shopping, working, driving, sporting, and entertaining. Note that ACF caters to the discrete data; as a consequence, the continuous sensor readings are needed to be transformed to some discrete groups. Therefore, we propose an Interval Length-Gini Discretization (LGD) method which considers the groups and misclassified cases to obtain the best hypothesis for a given set of data. After an appropriate discretization, we propose one-cut and memory-iteration-based approach to select a set of useful sensor-value pairs for reducing the model size by removing redundant features and guaranteeing an acceptable accuracy. In the experiments our framework has a good performance on real data set collected from 50 participants in eight months, and a smaller size than the existing classifications. ?

Three hundred and twenty-five residents at baseline were interviewed, and 206 completed the interviews at follow?up. Five outcomes including residents’ physical/mental functional status and subjective health status in Short Form?36 were analyzed using latent growth curve models (LGCMs).Results: Only the physical component summary (PCS) had increased significantly. The most influential risk factors to outcomes were the intra?individual-level time?varying variables, including self?rated health and with/without tubing care.

Although the symptoms of urticaria may increase stress, this association is not fully understood. Our aim was to analyze the risk of depression following a diagnosis of urticaria using a nationwide population-based study. Methods: We examined the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database. Patients who had a history of urticaria or depression prior to the study period were excluded. A total of 6742 adolescents (aged 13-18 years) who were hospitalized for a first-attack urticaria episode between 2006 and 2009 were recruited as a study group, together with 20,226 matched nonurticaria enrollees as a control group. Each patient was prospectively followed for 1 year to identify episodes of depression. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the risk of depression between the study and control groups, making adjustments for the patients' places of residence and sociodemographic characteristics. Depression-free survival curves were also analyzed. Finally, the risks of depression were analyzed between various age groups. Results: A total of 63 (0.9%) adolescents with urticaria and 61 (0.3%) nonurticarial control individuals suffered a new-onset episode of depression during the follow-up period. The stratified Cox proportional analysis indicated that the crude hazard ratio of depression among adolescents with urticaria was 1.86 times (95% confidence interval, 1.25-2.98) that of the control individuals without urticaria. Patients who were 16-18 years of age and who had a history of asthma were more likely to suffer from depression (p<0.05 for both). Finally, urticaria was determined to be a risk factor for depression only during adolescence and not in patients aged <13 years (n=6745) or those aged between 19 years and 24 years (n=7185). Conclusion: Individuals who experience an initial attack of urticaria during adolescence are at a higher risk for developing depression. ? 2014.",Adolescent; Depression; Hazard ratio; Pediatric; Urticaria,adolescent; adolescent disease; adult; Article; asthma; clinical examination; controlled study; data base; demography; depression; female; follow up; health insurance; hospital patient; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; prospective study; risk factor; survival rate; Taiwan; urticaria,2-s2.0-84908223881

Here, we investigated the role of collagen type XI alpha 1 (COL11A1) in cell invasiveness and tumor formation and the prognostic impact of COL11A1 expression in ovarian cancer. Microarray analysis suggested that COL11A1 is a disease progression-associated gene that is linked to ovarian cancer recurrence and poor survival. Small interference RNA-mediated specific reduction in COL11A1 protein levels suppressed the invasive ability and oncogenic potential of ovarian cancer cells and decreased tumor formation and lung colonization in mouse xenografts. A combination of experimental approaches, including real-time RT-PCR, casein zymography and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, showed that COL11A1 knockdown attenuated MMP3 expression and suppressed binding of Ets-1 to its putative MMP3 promoter-binding site, suggesting that the Ets-1-MMP3 axis is upregulated by COL11A1. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta (TGF-β1) treatment triggers the activation of smad2 signaling cascades, leading to activation of COL11A1 and MMP3. Pharmacological inhibition of MMP3 abrogated the TGF-β1-triggered, COL11A1-dependent cell invasiveness. Furthermore, the NF-YA-binding site on the COL11A1 promoter was identified as the major determinant of TGF-β1-dependent COL11A1 activation. Analysis of 88 ovarian cancer patients indicated that high COL11A1 mRNA levels are associated with advanced disease stage.

The distribution of sleep stages is a highly effective and objective way of quantifying sleep quality. As a standard multi-channel recording used in the study of sleep, polysomnography (PSG) is a widely used diagnostic scheme in sleep medicine. However, the standard process of sleep clinical test, including PSG recording and manual scoring, is complex, uncomfortable, and time-consuming. This process is difficult to implement when taking the whole PSG measurements at home for general healthcare purposes. This work presents a novel sleep stage classification system, based on features from the two forehead EEG channels FP1 and FP2. By recording EEG from forehead, where there is no hair, the proposed system can monitor physiological changes during sleep in a more practical way than previous systems. Through a headband or self-adhesive technology, the necessary sensors can be applied easily by users at home. Analysis results demonstrate that classification performance of the proposed system overcomes the individual differences between different participants in terms of automatically classifying sleep stages. Additionally, the proposed sleep stage classification system can identify kernel sleep features extracted from forehead EEG, which are closely related with sleep clinician's expert knowledge. Moreover, forehead EEG features are classified into five sleep stages by using the relevance vector machine. In a leave-one-subject-out cross validation analysis, we found our system to correctly classify five sleep stages at an average accuracy of 76.7 ± 4.0 (SD) % [average kappa 0.68 ± 0.06 (SD)]. Importantly, the proposed sleep stage classification system using forehead EEG features is a viable alternative for measuring EEG signals at home easily and conveniently to evaluate sleep quality reliably, ultimately improving public healthcare. ? 2014 Huang, Lin, Ko, Liu, Su and Lin.",Electroencephalogram (EEG); Polysomnography (PSG); Sleep quality; Sleep stage classification system; Sleep stages,adult; amplifier; Article; classification algorithm; controlled study; data extraction; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; eye movement; female; forehead electroencephalography; health care personnel; human; human experiment; intermethod comparison; knowledge; male; measurement accuracy; normal human; polysomnography; relevance vector machine; sensor; sleep; sleep quality; sleep stage; support vector machine,2-s2.0-84907933114

Gatekeeping of the mesopore is achieved using Pd(ii) templated, mechanically interlocked rotaxane nanovalves with a folic acid terminal group, anchored by a disulfide bridge as a snap-top on the surface. The active metal templated rotaxane approach helps in quick and irreversible gate formation for effective utilization of the drug. The folic acid head group bestows targeting capability, specifically to cancer cells. Once nanoparticles enter the cancer cell, controlled release of the cargo is triggered by cleavage of the disulfide bond using an endogenous glutathione stimulus. In addition to having efficient drug loading and controlled release mechanisms, this smart biocompatible carrier system showed obvious uptake and consequent release of the drug in HeLa cells, demonstrating its use as a potential theranostic material.

The supervised analysis showed that the most, abundant genera of bacteria in normal samples (from people with a body mass index (BMI) ? 24) were Bacteroides (27.7%), Prevotella (19.4%), Escherichia (12%), Phascolarctobacterium (3.9%), and Eubacterium (3.5%). The most abundant genera of bacteria in case samples (with a BMI ?27) were Bacteroides (29%), Prevotella (21%), Escherichia (7.4%), Megamonas (5.1%), and Phascolarctobacterium (3.8%). A principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) demonstrated that normal samples were clustered more compactly than case samples. An unsupervised analysis demonstrated that bacterial communities in the gut were clustered into two main groups: N-like and OB-like groups. Remarkably, most normal samples (78%) were clustered in the N-like group, and most case samples (81%) were clustered in the OB-like group (Fisher's P value = 1.61E-07). The results showed that bacterial communities in the gut were highly associated with obesity. This is the first study in Taiwan to investigate the association between human gut flora and obesity, and the results provide new insights into the correlation of bacteria with the rising trend in obesity.

For re-operations for battery replacement, a major issue is reducing treatment power consumption without compromising clinical benefits. To avoid side effects and to minimize power consumption, optimized adjustment of the stimulation parameters is required. This study thus proposes a scheme for determining the optimal stimulation parameters. An electromagnetic finite element model for a patient-specific physiological brain model is first established using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Using finite element analysis (FEA), varied stimulation parameters are applied to the electromagnetic model for VTA estimation. Optimal electrode contacts) are selected based on the estimated VTA to avoid side effects. Moreover, a nonlinear programming method for optimizing the stimulation voltage and the pulse width is applied to minimize power consumption in DBS. The effectiveness of the model parameters was verified using five Parkinson's disease patients. The results demonstrate that the estimates of the VTA are consistent with the observations within the desired region of the brain while avoiding side effects and reducing power consumption by 13% on average. The proposed method allows clinicians and researchers to efficiently select the optimal stimulation parameters.

Upon encapsulating an anticancer drug, camptothecin (CPT), the CHC-PY nanoparticles exhibited an excellent drug loading efficiency (>95%). The resulting CPT-loaded CHC-PY nanoparticles also exhibited efficient cell internalization and good pH-responsive behavior.

The prevalence of Internet addiction as assessed by CIAS-R was 18 %. High internal consistency and inter-item correlations were reported for the CIAS-R. Results from the confirmatory factor analysis suggested a four-factor structure of Compulsive Use and Withdrawal, Tolerance, Interpersonal and Health-related Problems, and Time Management Problems. Moreover, results of hierarchical multiple regression supported the incremental validity of the CIAS-R to predict mental health outcomes beyond the effects of demographic differences and self-reported time spent online.

Though the mRNA has been observed to induce cellular toxicity in FXTAS, the mechanisms are unclear. One common neurophysiological characteristic of FXTAS patients is their inability to properly attenuate their response to an auditory stimulus upon receipt of a small pre-stimulus. Therefore, to gain genetic and cell biological insight into FXTAS, we examined the effect of expanded CGG repeats on the plasticity of the olfactory response of the genetically tractable nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). While C. elegans is innately attracted to odors, this response can be downregulated if the odor is paired with starvation. We found that expressing expanded CGG repeats in olfactory neurons interfered with this plasticity without affecting either the innate odor-seeking response or the olfactory neuronal morphology. Interrogation of three RNA regulatory pathways indicated that the expanded CGG repeats act via the C. elegans microRNA (miRNA)-specific Argonaute ALG-2 to diminish olfactory plasticity. This observation suggests that the miRNA-Argonaute pathway may play a pathogenic role in subverting neuronal function in FXTAS. ? The Author 2014.

When the robot is in the grasping mode, the robot can fetch an object using computer vision and 6-DOF robot arms. When the user wants walking help, the robot can be configured to the supporting mode to provide walking assist. In the supporting mode, the robot arms are transformed to close and hold each other by the special designed buckle mechanism. A motion planning strategy is proposed to achieve arm-closing and buckle locking and unlocking. In this way, the robot arms are configured into a handrail for user support. Furthermore, a 6-DOF force/torque sensor is installed on the right robot arm to estimate the user's motion intent. The walking support system determines robot velocity based on a compliance controller to provide the walking assist. Several experiments validate the proposed design and demonstrate the dual-arm robot can provide user walking assist. ? 2014 IEEE.",,Robotic arms; 6-DOF robot arm; Dual-arm robot; Force/torque sensor; Planning strategies; Robot velocity; Walking assists; Walking support; Walking support systems; Walking aids,2-s2.0-84906534911

Dating back to traffic conflict studies from the 1960s these observational studies of driver behavior have been criticized due to: poor quality data; lack of available and useful exposure measures linked to the observations; the incomparability of self-reported safety-related events; and, the difficulty in assessing culpability for safety-related events. This study seeks to explore the relationships between driver characteristics and traffic safety-related events, and between traffic safety-related events and crash involvement while mitigating some of those limitations. The Virginia Tech Transportation Institute 100-Car Naturalistic Driving Study dataset, in which the participants' vehicles were instrumented with various cameras and sensors during the study period, was used for this study. The study data set includes 90 drivers observed for 12-13 months driving. This study focuses on single vehicle run-off-road safety-related events only, including 14 crashes and 182 safety-related events (30 near crashes, and 152 crash-relevant incidents). Among the findings are: (1) drivers under age 25 are significantly more likely to be involved in safety-related events and crashes; and (2) significantly positive correlations exist between crashes, near crashes, and crash-relevant incidents. Although there is still much to learn about the factors affecting the positive correlation between safety-related events and crashes, a Bayesian multivariate Poisson log-normal model is shown to be useful to quantify the associations between safety-related events and crash risk while controlling for driver characteristics. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Multivariate Poisson log-normal models; Naturalistic driving data; Safety-related events; Surrogate events,"Accident prevention; Accidents; Crashworthiness; Log-normal model; Naturalistic driving data; Naturalistic driving studies; Observational study; Positive correlations; Road safety analysis; Safety-related events; Surrogate events; Automobile safety devices; adolescent; adult; age; aged; Bayes theorem; car driving; female; human; male; middle aged; multivariate analysis; Poisson distribution; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; traffic accident; young adult; Accidents, Traffic; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Automobile Driving; Bayes Theorem; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Multivariate Analysis; Poisson Distribution; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84905389750

Researches done in the literature all focused on how to reduce the computation complexity of the filter bank. In particular, with the efficient multirate and interpolated FIR (IFIR) approaches for a 10-ms, 18-band quasi-ANSI filter bank, approximately 93% of the multiplications are saved, compared that with a straightforward parallel FIR filters architecture. However, they did not consider the computation complexity of the sub-band signal processing. In this paper, we first investigate realizing the FIR filter bank efficiently by using the multirate re-sampling techniques. To reduce the complexity, the optimized re-sampling factor for each filter band is explored carefully. Then, with the resampling technique, an efficient multirate quasi-ANSI FIR filter bank architecture is proposed. Compare to the state-of-the-art quasi-ANSI filter bank, approximately 17.7% of multiplicative complexity is reduced further and, up to 25% of the total computation complexity for sub-band signal processing followed by the filter bank is saved, but with only a slight increase in latency, i.e. 13.6 ms. ? 2014 IEEE.",ANSI S1.11; Filter bank; hearing-aids; real-time application,Audition; FIR filters; Hearing aids; Noise abatement; ANSI S1.11; Computation complexity; Digital hearing aids; Multiplicative complexity; Parallel FIR filter; Real-time application; Resampling technique; Wide dynamic range; Filter banks,2-s2.0-84905280453

The energy of received X-ray could reveal the density inside human body and be represented in an X-ray image. In general, the bright regions of an X-ray image are of interest since most important matters compactly locating in those regions. However, the low contrast property of the bright regions makes inspectors hard to tell the details. Hence, contrast enhancement of X-ray images especially in the bright regions becomes critical. In the paper, unlike previous algorithms which work well in the dark regions, we thus proposed a tissue attenuation method to enhance the bright regions. We assume the X-ray intensity is composed of tissues and other important details. By locally attenuating the ratios of tissues over the image, we could adaptively enhance the important details especially in the bright regions. To adjust the ratios, a two-step procedure was proposed. First, the tissue component was separated from a given image based on local contrast maximization. Second, an attenuation adjustment was performed to control the ratio of removable tissues in order to correctly enhance contrast. Experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. ? 2014 IEEE.",Contrast Enhancement; Contrast Maximization; Tissue Attenuation; X-ray Imaging,Histology; Signal processing; X ray analysis; Contrast Enhancement; Local contrast; Low contrast; Tissue attenuation; Tissue components; Two-step procedure; X ray intensity; Xray imaging; Tissue,2-s2.0-84905268875

Participants were members of the Beaver Dam Offspring Study, a study of the adult children of participants in the population-based Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study.

Outcomes included 5-year change in body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, and hedonic ratings of specific foods. Cluster analysis with Ward's minimum variance method identified the following 5 patterns of the suprathreshold taste intensities of salt, sweet, sour, and bitter: salt and sweet intensities slightly above population averages, average sour and bitter intensities; salt, sour, and bitter intensities above population average, average sweet intensity; salt, sour, and bitter intensities above population average, sweet intensity substantially above average; all intensities below population averages; and all intensities close to population average. The General Linear Model procedure was used for testing cluster differences in the outcomes. With covariate adjustment, the group with all intensities close to population averages had a significantly lower average increase in body mass index compared with the group with above-average intensities for salt, sour, and bitter (+0.4 vs+0.9), and in glycosylated hemoglobin A1c compared with the group with above-average intensities for all tastes (+0.20% vs+0.34%).

Thus, it is important to accurately determine the species of pathogenic yeasts, especially when more than one species are in a specimen. Methods: Clinically significant yeast isolates were collected via the Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance of Yeasts from July to September in 2010. The identifications of isolates were assessed in the core laboratory at the National Health Research Institutes. Results: Of the 1127 isolates recovered, 1088 were of Candida genus, accounting for 96.53% of the total isolates, followed by Cryptococcus (15, 1.33%), Trichosporon (12, 1.06%), Kodamaea (4, 0.35%), Pichia (4, 0.35%), and three others. In all, 38 out of 1116 (3.4%) specimens had mixed yeast cultures. One ascites specimen had three species, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Candida tropicalis. In the remaining 37 specimens, 16 had a combination of C. albicans and C. glabrata, eight C. albicans and C. tropicalis, five C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, three Candida krusei and C. tropicalis, and five with different combinations. Conclusion: The high prevalence of cultures with mixed yeasts may be an emerging issue.

Dysregulation of miRNA gene, either upregulated or downregulated, may lead to severe diseases or oncogenesis, especially when the miRNA disorder involves significant bioreactions or pathways. Thus, how miRNA genes are transcriptionally regulated has been highlighted as well as target recognition in recent years. In this study, a large-scale investigation of novel cis- and trans-elements was undertaken to further determine TF-miRNA regulatory relations, which are necessary to unravel the transcriptional regulation of miRNA genes. Based on miRNA and annotated gene expression profiles, the term ""coTFBS"" was introduced to detect common transcription factors and the corresponding binding sites within the promoter regions of each miRNA and its coexpressed annotated genes. The computational pipeline was successfully established to filter redundancy due to short sequence motifs for TFBS pattern search. Eventually, we identified more convinced TF-miRNA regulatory relations for 225 human miRNAs. This valuable information is helpful in understanding miRNA functions and provides knowledge to evaluate the therapeutic potential in clinical research. Once most expression profiles of miRNAs in the latest database are completed, TF candidates of more miRNAs can be explored by this filtering approach in the future. ? 2014 Chia-Hung Chien et al.",,"microRNA; transcription factor; microRNA; transcription factor; article; binding site; carcinogenesis; gene expression; human; human genome; molecular recognition; promoter region; regulatory mechanism; biology; biosynthesis; gene expression regulation; gene regulatory network; genetics; molecular genetics; Binding Sites; Computational Biology; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genome, Human; Humans; MicroRNAs; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Transcription Factors",2-s2.0-84903643228

Additionally, dextran molecules covalently bound with fluorescent dyes are frequently used as tracers in animal studies. These facts show that dextrans are useful compounds for biomedicine-related applications and research. Our aim was to explore a facile way to generate dextran-derived nanoparticles with photoluminescent property for the use in fluorescence imaging of bacteria and cancer cells. Dextran-encapsulated gold nanoclusters (AuNCs@dextran) were generated through a one-pot reaction by stirring dextrans and aqueous tetrachloroauric acid overnight. The generated AuNCs exhibit bright and green photoluminescence under the illumination of an ultraviolet lamp (λmax = 365 nm), and high cell biocompatibility was found as well. Therefore, the generated AuNCs can be used as fluorescence tracers and nanoprobes. We explored the suitability of AuNCs@dextran as labeling agents for bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. After the bacteria were labeled by AuNCs@dextran, they became quite visible under a fluorescence microscope. Additionally, we demonstrated that nanocomposites composed of AuNCs@dextran and silica beads can be readily internalized by cancer cells. The nanocomposites can be readily detected in the cells through their photoluminescence, suggesting possible applications in drug delivery and fluorescence imaging. ? 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.",Bacteria; Cancer cells; Dextran; Gold nanoclusters; Imaging; Photoluminescence,Bacteria; Biocompatibility; Cells; Drug delivery; Escherichia coli; Fluorescence; Gold; Imaging techniques; Medical applications; Nanoclusters; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Photoluminescence; Synthesis (chemical); Biomedical applications; Cancer cells; Cell biocompatibilities; Fluorescence imaging; Gold nanocluster; Green photoluminescence; Photo-luminescent properties; Staphylococcus aureus; Dextran; dextran; fluorescent dye; gold; gold nanocluster; nanocomposite; nanoparticle; silicon dioxide; unclassified drug; article; bacterial cell; biocompatibility; cancer cell; controlled study; encapsulation; Escherichia coli; fluorescence imaging; fluorescence microscopy; illumination; nanoprobe; nonhuman; one pot synthesis; optics; photoluminescence; priority journal; Staphylococcus aureus; synthesis; ultraviolet radiation,2-s2.0-84902225803

In the drug-resistant subgroup, the MDs of SS and PTR and the FAs of SS and PLIC were significantly different.

This emerging material class presents unique properties derived from the combination of nanosized domains in the form of colloidal particles with a continuous gel network and an interspersed liquid phase.

The results highlight that incorporated substances and preparation procedures have effects both on mechanical properties and drug release, but that the release of drug loaded in the colloidal carriers is mainly limited by transport out of the carriers, rather than by diffusion within the gel. The developed colloidal chitosan based gels hold outstanding biomedical potential, as confirmed by the ease of preparation and administration, low cytotoxicity in MTT assay, excellent biocompatibility and lowering of intraocular pressure for 40 days in a rabbit glaucoma model.

Epidemiological and animal studies show the possibility of inhalation transmission. However, no B. pseudomallei concentrations in ambient air have been researched. Here, we developed a method to quantify ambient B. pseudomallei and then measured concentrations of ambient B. pseudomallei during the typhoon season and the non-typhoon season to determine the factors influencing ambient B. pseudomallei levels.Methods:We quantified ambient B. pseudomallei by using a filter/real-time qPCR method in the Zoynan Region in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan. Twenty-four hour samples were collected at a sampling rate of 20 L/min every day from June 11 to December 21, 2012 including during the typhoon season (June to September) and reference season (October to December).Results:We successfully developed a filtration/real-time qPCR method to quantify ambient B. pseudomallei. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing concentrations of ambient B. pseudomallei. Ambient B. pseudomallei were only detected during the typhoon season when compared to the reference season. For the typhoons affecting the Zoynan Region, the positive rates of ambient B. pseudomallei were very high at 80% to 100%. During June to December, rainfall was positively correlated with ambient B. pseudomallei with a statistical significance. Sediment at a nearby pond significantly influenced the concentration of ambient B. pseudomallei. During the typhoon month, the typhoon was positively correlated with ambient B. pseudomallei whereas wind speed was reversely correlated with ambient B. pseudomallei.Conclusions:Our data suggest the possibility of transmission of B. pseudomallei via inhalation during the typhoon season. ? 2014 Chen et al.",,article; bacterial transmission; Burkholderia pseudomallei; colony forming unit; environmental sanitation; health survey; human; hurricane; infection control; melioidosis; nonhuman; real time polymerase chain reaction; Taiwan; animal; endemic disease; epidemiology; genetics; hurricane; isolation and purification; melioidosis; microbiology; season; Air Microbiology; Animals; Burkholderia pseudomallei; Cyclonic Storms; Endemic Diseases; Humans; Melioidosis; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Seasons; Taiwan,2-s2.0-84901773508

For hemodialysis, consistently functional vascular access must be surgically created with an anastomosis of artery and vein, referred to as an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). However, AVF dysfunction may occur over time. Angiography and Doppler ultrasound are usually used to detect the flow or the diameter of the AVF. But they require well-trained operators and are expensive, and even angiography is invasive. In this study, a noninvasive approach based on stethoscope auscultation for monitoring AVF stenosis was proposed. Here, a wireless blood flow sound recorder was designed to record blood flow sounds wirelessly. In order to effectively extract the varying feature of blood flow sounds for AVF stenosis, the 2-D feature pattern built from S-transform was also proposed as the feature in the AVF stenosis detecting algorithm. Different from other frequency-related coefficients, the feature pattern can contain the information of blood flow sounds in time and frequency domains simultaneously. Preliminary findings showed that the proposed approach can provide high-quality estimation of AVF stenosis (positive predictive value = 87.84% and sensitivity = 89.24%). ? 1964-2012 IEEE.",Arteriovenous fistula (AVF); blood flow sounds; hemodialysis; S-transform; stethoscope auscultation,"Angiography; Dialysis; Hemodialyzers; Patient treatment; Arteriovenous fistulas; Blood flow; hemodialysis; S transforms; stethoscope auscultation; Hemodynamics; adult; algorithm; arteriovenous fistula stenosis; artery blood flow; article; artificial neural network; auscultation; blood flow; blood flow sound recorder; blood vessel diameter; cardiovascular equipment; Doppler echography; end stage renal disease; hemodialysis; human; major clinical study; microprocessor; non invasive procedure; predictive value; radial basis function; radial basis function neural network; s transform; stenosis; stethoscope; stethoscope auscultation; arteriovenous shunt; auscultation; blood flow velocity; Constriction, Pathologic; devices; pathophysiology; physiologic monitoring; physiology; procedures; renal replacement therapy; signal processing; Vascular Diseases; young adult; Adult; Algorithms; Arteriovenous Shunt, Surgical; Auscultation; Blood Flow Velocity; Constriction, Pathologic; Humans; Monitoring, Physiologic; Renal Dialysis; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Stethoscopes; Vascular Diseases; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84901286420

This study was focused on examining whether an HPS action-research approach was effective in advancing HPS implementation, perceived HPS impact and perceived HPS efficacy in Taiwan. In 2011, questionnaires were sent to 900 sample schools in Taiwan. A total of 621 schools returned the questionnaire, including 488 primary schools and 133 middle schools. The response rate was 69%. This study compared the difference in HPS implementation status, perceived HPS impact and perceived HPS efficacy between those schools that had implemented actionresearch HPS (138 schools) and those that had not (483 schools). The univariate analysis results indicated that the HPS implementation levels for components that included school health policies, physical environment, social environment, teaching activities and schoolcommunity relations were significantly higher in actionresearch schools than in non-Action-research schools. Teachers in action-research schools reported significantly higher levels of HPS impact and HPS efficacy than non-Action-research schools. The multivariate analysis results indicated that after controlling for school level and HPS funding, the HPS action-research approach was significantly positively related to greater levels of HPS implementation, perceived HPS impact and perceived HPS efficacy.?

A key challenge in creating CL-DNA complexes for application is that their transfection efficiency (TE) is adversely affected by serum. In particular, little is known about the effects of a high serum content on TE, even though this may provide design guidelines for application in vivo. Methods: We prepared CL-DNA complexes in which we varied the neutral lipid [1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerophosphatidylcholine, glycerol-monooleate (GMO), cholesterol], the headgroup charge and chemical structure of the cationic lipid, and the ratio of neutral to cationic lipid; we then measured the TE of these complexes as a function of serum content and assessed their cytotoxicity. We tested selected formulations in two human cancer cell lines (M21/melanoma and PC-3/prostate cancer). Results: In the absence of serum, all CL-DNA complexes of custom-synthesized multivalent lipids show high TE. Certain combinations of multivalent lipids and neutral lipids, such as MVL5(5+)/GMO-DNA complexes or complexes based on the dendritic-headgroup lipid TMVLG3(8+) exhibited high TE both in the absence and presence of serum. Although their TE still dropped to a small extent in the presence of serum, it reached or surpassed that of benchmark commercial transfection reagents, particularly at a high serum content. Conclusions: Two-component vectors (one multivalent cationic lipid and one neutral lipid) can rival or surpass benchmark reagents at low and high serum contents (up to 50%, v/v). We propose guidelines for optimizing the serum resistance of CL-DNA complexes based on a given cationic lipid. ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Cationic liposomes; Gene delivery; Glycerol monooleate; Multivalent cationic lipid; Serum,"1,2 dioleoyl 3 trimethylammoniopropane; dioleoylphosphatidylcholine; DNA; glycerol oleate; lipid; lipofectamine; liposome; 1,2-dioleoyloxy-3-(trimethylammonium)propane; benzamide derivative; cation; DNA; lipid; liposome; monounsaturated fatty acid; N1-(2-(1-((3-aminopropyl)amino)-4-(di-(3-aminopropyl)amino)butylcarboxamido)ethyl)-3,4-di-(oleyloxy)benzamide; quaternary ammonium derivative; spermine; animal cell; article; chemical structure; complex formation; controlled study; culture medium; cytotoxicity; genetic transfection; human; human cell; in vitro gene transfer; in vivo gene transfer; L cell line; lipid blood level; lipid composition; lipogenesis; liposomal gene delivery system; melanoma cell line; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; prostate cancer cell line; analogs and derivatives; chemistry; Escherichia coli; gene therapy; gene transfer; genetics; plasmid; procedures; serum; tumor cell line; Benzamides; Cations; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA; Escherichia coli; Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated; Gene Transfer Techniques; Genetic Therapy; Humans; Lipids; Liposomes; Plasmids; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; Serum; Spermine; Transfection",2-s2.0-84900419358

Methods A prospective study was conducted in the pediatric intensive care unit. Children with NMD and ARF treated by combined NIV and MIE were included. Treatment success was defined as freedom from tracheal intubation during the hospital stay. Physiologic indices including PaO2, PaCO2, pH, and PaO2/FiO2 were recorded before and 12, 24 hr after the use of NIV/MIE. Results Combined NIV/MIE was used in 15 NMD children (mean: 8.1 years, range: 3 months to 18 years) with 16 cases of ARF. There was no mortality in this cohort. Treatment success was achieved in 12 cases (75%), including six cases (38%) demanding ""Do Not Intubate."" ARF was due to pneumonia, with a mean baseline PaCO2 of 73.2 ± 19.0 mmHg. In the success group, hypercarbia and acidosis improved after use of NIV/MIE for 24 hr (PaCO2: 71.7 ± 18.6 mmHg vs. 55.8 ± 11.6 mmHg, P &lt; 0.01; pH: 7.29 ± 0.07 vs. 7.38 ± 0.05, P &lt; 0.01). All patients tolerated NIV/MIE well despite transient skin pressure sores in five cases. Conclusions Combined NIV/MIE is a safe and effective approach to rapidly improve physiologic indices and decrease the need for intubation in NMD children with ARF.

During GD progression, T cells secrete interleukin-16 (IL-16) to promote inflammation, act as chemoattractants that recruit more inflammatory cells, and activate target cells to enhance the development of GD. To investigate the role of IL-16 in GD, we genotyped 474 patients with GD at 8 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-16 gene. The IL-16 SNP rs8028364 was found to be associated with GD when compared with the control subjects (P = 2.93 × 10 -17 ; CG genotype: odds ratio [OR] = 0.2 [0.07, 0.59]; CC genotype: OR = 0.03 [0.01, 0.09]).

To understand better the potential adverse effect of nasopharyngeal ICA aberrancy on routine nasopharyngeal surgery, we classified aberrant nasopharyngeal ICAs and analyzed the differences in mean distances from the ICA to nasopharyngeal subsites between aberrant and nonaberrant vessels. Methods: The courses of nasopharyngeal ICAs were examined and classified for an aberrant pathway. Various distances were measured on magnetic resonance brain scans. The mean values of the measured variables were compared using an unpaired two-sample t test. Results: The mean distances to the torus tubarius, the opening of Rosenmuller's fossa, and the posterior nasopharyngeal wall were 19.6mm, 15.8mm, and 16.7mm, respectively, in the aberrant case group, and 23.1mm (p<0.001), 19.8mm (p<0.001), and 20.7mm (p<0.001) in the nonaberrant control group. Conclusion: The mean distances between the ICA and nasopharyngeal subsites were significantly shortened (by 15-21%) in the presence of aberrant nasopharyngeal segments, which may increase the risk of severe complications in common and uncomplicated nasopharyngeal surgery, such as adenoidectomy, eustachian tuboplasty, and nasopharyngeal biopsies.

CAPD patients underwent repeat resting echocardiography at 2 years. Results LV ejection fraction was normal in the CAPD (67.1 ± 8.5%) and control (68.9 ± 3.4%) groups. There was also no significant difference in baseline SDI between the CAP (1.55 ± 1.10) and control (1.21 ± 0.52) groups, while SDI of peak dose dopamine wa significantly higher in the CAPD group (P = 0.012). The CAPD group showe significantly greater end diastolic volume (EDV), end systolic volume (ESV), LV mass indexes, and wall stress than those measured in normal subjects. After 2 years subgroup with higher peak-stage SDIs had significantly increased LV mass index, LV volume, left atrium, right ventricular dimensions, MR severity, and LV sphericity as compared with lower peak-stage SDIs subgroup in CAPD patients. Conclusion Dynamic LV dyssynchrony develops in CAPD patients during DSE, and correlates with the 2-year's unfavorable echocardiography outcomes. It may serve as a novel index of increased risk of worsening LV echocardiographic outcome at an early stage in CAPD patients regardless of preserved normal ejection fraction.",3D dobutamine stress echocardiography; CAPD; LV dyssynchrony,amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; dobutamine; dopamine; adult; article; continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis; controlled study; correlational study; dobutamine stress echocardiography; female; heart left atrium; heart left ventricle dyssynchrony; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart left ventricle endsystolic volume; heart left ventricle failure; heart left ventricle mass; heart left ventricle volume; heart ventricle size; human; major clinical study; male; mitral valve regurgitation; prognosis; stress echocardiography; systolic dyssynchrony index; three dimensional echocardiography; wall stress,2-s2.0-84898877872

Most traffic accidents are caused by driver carelessness on traffic conditions. The driving dispute is a critical problem for drivers when the car accident is happened. The drivers usually install the car video recorder in their car to recode their driving images in recent years. If a traffic accident being happened, the driver can provide a driving video file as an evidence to claim that they did not conduct any dangerous driving behaviors for protecting themselves from suspicions. However, under some such situations, drivers may not stay in their car accident when driving the car, but they have similar requirements for a video record, because they need to use those video files to find out the crime in some hit-and-run accidents. The goal of this paper is to develop a platform which can allow user to share their driving videos by using smart wearable devices and allow other users to search traffic video by some given specific time, date and location from the platforms' database. ? 2014 IEEE.",,Consumer electronics; Video recording; Critical problems; Dangerous drivings; Search traffics; Sharing platforms; Smart wearables; Traffic conditions; Traffic videos; Video recorders; Highway accidents,2-s2.0-84898688054

It is well understood that hypertension and diabetesmellitus (DM) are important risk factors for AF. Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-4) inhibitors are newagents in the fight against type 2 DM, though they have been found to have several cardiovascular effects. However, it is not clear whether DPP-4 may modulate the electrical and mechanical characteristics in hypertensive atrium or PVs. Methods: Conventional microelectrodes were used to record the action potentials (APs) in isolated PVs, right atrium (RA), and left atrium (LA) in Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with or without sitagliptin (10 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. Results: WKY ( n = 5), SHR ( n = 7), sitagliptin-treated WKY ( n = 5) and sitagliptin-treated SHR ( n = 7) had similar PV or sinoatrial spontaneous beating rates. However, the sitagliptin-treated WKY had fewer sinoatrial-PV beating rate differences than WKY, SHR or sitagliptin-treated SHR. WKY and SHR had shorter 90% (APD 90) of RA AP duration than sitagliptin-treated WKY or sitagliptin-treated SHR. In contrast, WKY had longer LA APD90 than sitagliptin-treated WKY, but SHR and sitagliptin-treated SHR had similar LA APD90. Sitagliptin-treated WKY or sitagliptin-treated SHR had larger (RA-LA) APD90 differences than WKY or SHR, respectively. Moreover, as compared to WKY the post-rest potentiation of contraction was decreased in SHR, sitagliptin-treated WKY, and sitagliptin-treated SHR.

However, its receptor (IGFIIR) cannot be found in normal adult hearts. Moreover, a mouse IGFII overexpression model showed a heart and kidney hypertrophy phenomenon similar to Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome in humans. The previous studies from our lab showed that an increase in AngII in H9c2 cells causes an elevation in IGFII and IGFIIR through MEK and JNK activation, leading toa rise in intracellular Ca2+ ions, activation of calcineurin by PLC-β3 via Gαq, insertion into mitochondrial membranes of BAD, and apoptosis via activation of caspases 9 and 3.

Twenty-three MDD patients, twenty-five BD patients, and twenty-four normal controls were enrolled and their event-related magnetoencephalographic responses were recorded during implicit emotional tasks. Our results demonstrated abnormal gamma activity within 100 ms in the emotion-related regions (amygdala, orbitofrontal (OFC) cortex, anterior insula (AI), and superior temporal pole) in the MDD patients, suggesting that these patients may have dysfunctions or negativity biases in perceptual binding of emotional features at very early stage. Decreased left superior medial frontal cortex (smFC) responses to happy faces in the MDD patients were correlated with their serious level of depression symptoms, indicating that decreased smFC activity perhaps underlies irregular positive emotion processing in depressed patients. In the BD patients, we showed abnormal activation in visual regions (inferior/middle occipital and middle temporal cortices) which responded to emotional faces within 100 ms, supporting that the BD patients may hyperactively respond to emotional features in perceptual binding. The discriminant function of gamma activation in the left smFC, right medial OFC, right AI/inferior OFC, and the right precentral cortex accurately classified 89.6% of patients as unipolar/bipolar disorders. ? 2014 T.

Its spectrum analysis provides the powerful means of observing the modulation between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. The timescale of HRV is limited by discrete beat-to-beat time intervals; therefore, the exploration region of frequency band of HRV spectrum is relatively narrow. It had been proved that pulse rate variability (PRV) is a surrogate measurement of HRV in most of the circumstances. Moreover, arterial pulse wave contains small oscillations resulting from complex regulation of cardiac pumping function and vascular tone at higher frequency range. This study proposed a novel instantaneous PRV (iPRV) measurement based on Hilbert-Huang transform. Fifteen healthy subjects participated in this study and received continuous blood pressure wave recording in supine and passive head-up tilt. The result showed that the very-high-frequency band (0.4-0.9 Hz) varied during head-up tilt and had strong correlation (r = 0.77) with high-frequency band and medium correlation (r = 0.643) with baroreflex sensitivity. The very-high-frequency band of iPRV helps for the exploration of non-stationary autoregulation and provides the non-stationary spectral evaluation of HRV without distortion or information loss. ? 2014 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.",Heart rate variability; Hilbert-Huang transform; Pulse rate variability,"Blood pressure; Frequency bands; Heart; Spectrum analysis; Baroreflex sensitivities; Heart rate variability; High frequency bands; Hilbert Huang transforms; Parasympathetic nervous systems; Pulse rate variability; Regulatory mechanism; Small oscillations; Optical pumping; adult; article; blood vessel tone; cardiovascular autoregulation; electrocardiogram; female; head tilting; heart rate variability; human; male; measurement; normal human; plethysmography; priority journal; pulse rate; pulse wave; spectroscopy; Adult; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Plethysmography; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Spectrum Analysis",2-s2.0-84897107743

In this study, a novel method for determining the mass size distribution of BC in atmospheric aerosols was developed. This size-segregation method relies on measuring BC in parallel using two aethalometers, one of which is used to measure the total BC (BCT) mass concentration as a reference level and the other is used to measure the BC (BCi) mass concentration for BC sizes below specific particle sizes that are selected using a size cut-off inlet. In this study, this method was applied to measure BC in atmospheric samples at an urban traffic site. The aethalometers were operated continually from December 15, 2012 to January 31, 2013, and from February 15, 2013 to March 31, 2013. The measurement results presented in this paper are for the diurnal variation patterns, average concentrations, mass fractions, and size distributions of BC aerosols. The results indicate that BCT mass concentration is approximately 2.8μgm-3 in the Taipei urban area. The levels of BC at this sampling site were affected markedly by traffic emission levels and local wind speed. At the sampling site, the average BC2.5/BCT, BC1.0/BCT, BC0.5/BCT, BC0.25/BCT, and BC0.1/BCT were 0.96±0.04, 0.92±0.07, 0.89±0.04, 0.73±0.10, and 0.18±0.08, respectively. The results indicate that approximately 90% of the BC aerosols were smaller than 0.5μm, that most of the BC aerosols (55%) were in the size range of 0.1-0.25μm, and that approximately 18% of the BC aerosols were ultrafine. Moreover, the daily average mass size distribution of BC exhibited a single accumulation mode at 0.16μm at this sampling site. The mode of the BC mass size distribution at rush hour (9 AM) was only 0.14μm, which is smaller than the daily average. Moreover, the mode of the BC mass size distribution at an early morning hour (3 AM) was 0.18μm, and a minor coarse mode was also observed during this period. The results further revealed that the geometric diameter (Dpg) of the BC aerosols varied between 0.14 and 0.22μm and the geometric standard deviation (σg) of these BC aerosols ranged between 1.4 and 2.3 during the sampling period. Because BC exhibits extremely low chemical reactivity; the size distribution of BC in the atmosphere does not change substantially except through coagulation. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Black carbon; Mass size distribution; Size segregation; Taipei urban area,Atmospheric aerosols; Particle size; Segregation (metallography); Size distribution; Atmospheric samples; Average concentration; Black carbon; Geometric standard deviations; Mass size distribution; Particle size spectra; Size segregation; Urban areas; Urban growth; black carbon; aerosol; black carbon; coagulation; diurnal variation; particle size; pollution monitoring; size distribution; traffic emission; urban area; urban pollution; wind velocity; aerosol; article; atmosphere; bioaccumulation; chemical parameters; chemical procedures; circadian rhythm; controlled study; mass size distribution; particle size; priority journal; sampling; size segregation; Taiwan; traffic; urban area; velocity; wind; Taipei; Taiwan,2-s2.0-84897070248

The obtained dual functional spherical-shaped nanoclusters showed low cytotoxicity, and high cellular uptake efficiency. The AuNRs at MnMEIOs nanoclusters also demonstrated a 1.9 and 2.2 folds r2 relaxivity value higher than those of monodispersed MnMEIO and Resovist.

One of the goals in traffic safety research is to search for an effective treatment to reduce fatal and major injury crashes, referred to as severe crashes. To achieve this goal, the selection of promising countermeasures is of utmost importance, and relies on the effectiveness of candidate countermeasures in reducing severe crashes. Although it is important to precisely evaluate the effectiveness of candidate countermeasures in reducing the number of severe crashes at a site, the current state-of-the-practice often leads to biased estimates. While there have been a few advanced statistical models developed to mitigate the problem in practice, these models are computationally difficult to estimate because severe crashes are dispersed spatially and temporally, and cannot be integrated into the Highway Safety Manual framework, which develops a series of safety performance functions and crash modification factors to predict the number of crashes. Crash severity outcomes are generally integrated into the Highway Safety Manual using deterministic distributions rather than statistical models. Accounting for the variability in crash severity as a function geometric design, traffic flow, and other roadway and roadside features is afforded by estimating statistical models. Therefore, there is a need to develop a new analysis paradigm to resolve the limitations in the current Highway Safety Manual methods. We propose an approach which decomposes the severe crash frequency into a function of the change in the total number of crashes and the probability of a crash becoming a severe crash before and after a countermeasure is implemented. We tested this approach by evaluating the effectiveness of shoulder rumble strips on reducing the number of severe crashes. A total of 310 segments that have had shoulder rumble strips installed during 2002-2009 are included in the analysis. It was found that shoulder rumble strips reduce the total number of crashes, but have no statistically significant effect on reducing the probability of a severe crash outcome. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Crash severity; Fixed-effects model; Heavy trucks; Motorcycles; Pedestrians; Shoulder rumble strips,"Estimation; Highway engineering; Motorcycles; Safety engineering; Traffic control; Crash severity; Fixed-effects; Heavy truck; Pedestrians; Rumble strips; Function evaluation; accident prevention; cross-sectional study; environmental planning; epidemiology; evaluation study; human; mortality; prevention and control; procedures; safety; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; traffic accident; United States; Wounds and Injuries; Accident Prevention; Accidents, Traffic; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environment Design; Humans; Models, Statistical; Pennsylvania; Safety; Wounds and Injuries",2-s2.0-84896498357

The Gd-TTDA-BOM complex expresses higher and longer enhancement in mouse liver than that of gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) because of its faster water exchange rate, higher reorientation time, and higher lipophilicity. Phantom studies have shown that Gd-TTDA-BOM has expressed with higher affinity to human serum albumin (HSA) than Gd-DTPA. In general, these characteristics might provide an advantage for vascular imaging. To verify this in vivo, a 3T MR scanner was used to investigate the signal enhancement in the aorta of normal rats by DCE-MRA after the bolus injection of Gd-TTDA-BOM and compared this with the injection of Gd-DTPA.

Design Cohort study. Methods The BOSS (2005-2008) is a study of aging in the adult offspring of the population-based Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study cohort. Questionnaire data on health history, medication use, risk factors, and quality of life were available for 3275 participants. Dry eye was determined by self-report of frequency of symptoms and the intensity of those symptoms. Associations between dry eye and risk factors were analyzed using logistic regression. Results The prevalence of dry eye in the BOSS was 14.5%: 17.9% of women and 10.5% of men. In a multivariate model, statistically significant associations were found with female sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-2.11), current contact lens use (OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.53-2.64), allergies (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.22-2.08), arthritis (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.12-1.85), thyroid disease (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.02-1.99), antihistamine use (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.18-2.02), and steroid use (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.16-2.06). Dry eye was also associated with lower scores on the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (β = -3.9, P <.0001) as well as on the National Eye Institute 25-Item Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) (β = -3.4, P <.0001) when controlling for age, sex, and comorbid conditions. Conclusions The prevalence of dry eye and its associated risk factors in the BOSS were similar to previous studies. In this study, dry eye was associated with lower quality of life on a health-related quality-of-life instrument and the vision-specific NEI VFQ-25. ? 2014 BY ELSEVIER INC.

This may be due to the chemoresistant behaviors of HCC. It is believed that acquired resistance could be overcome and improve the overall survival of HCC patients by understanding the mechanisms of chemoresistance in HCC. A stable HA22T cancer line, which is chronically resistant to a histone deacetylase inhibitor, was established. After comparing the molecular mechanism of apicidin-R HA22T cells to parental ones by Western blotting, cell cycle-regulated proteins did not change in apicidin-R cells, but apicidin-R cells were more proliferative and had higher tumor growth (wound-healing assay and nude mice xenograft model). Moreover, apicidin-R cells displayed increased levels of p-IGF-IR, p-PI3K, p-Akt, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2 but also significantly inhibited the tumor suppressor PTEN protein and apoptotic pathways when compared to the parental strain. Therefore, the highly proliferative effect of apicidin-R HA22T cells was blocked by Akt knockdown. For all these findings, we believe that novel strategies to attenuate IGF-IR/PI3K/Akt signaling could overcome chemoresistance toward the improvement of overall survival of HCC patients. ? 2013 International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).",Akt; Apicidina HA22T; Hepatocellular carcinoma cells; IGF-IR·PI3K,"apicidin; cyclin A; cyclin B1; cyclin D; cytochrome c; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; protein BAD; protein bcl 2; protein bcl xl; protein kinase B; somatomedin receptor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; article; cancer growth; cancer size; carcinoma cell; cell death; cell population; cell proliferation; cell survival; cell viability; comparative study; controlled study; human; human cell; IC 50; liver cell carcinoma; mouse; MTT assay; nonhuman; oncogene c myc; priority journal; signal transduction; tumor xenograft; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Disease Models, Animal; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Humans; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Liver Neoplasms; Mice; Peptides, Cyclic; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Receptor, IGF Type 1; RNA Interference; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-84893701178

Besides enhancing transfection efficiency, the difficulty in gene therapy is how to deliver sufficient gene molecules to the site of interest. Herein, the rational design of surfactant-free lipo-polymersomes (LPPs) to overcome these problems is reported, simultaneously using a lipid-stabilized double emulsion approach. The LPPs are designed to conceal the cationic lipids and plasmid DNA inside the core along with iron oxide nanoparticles/polymer interlayer and a relatively neutral lipid shell to avoid the undesired interaction during circulation, leading to high accumulation in the tumors of mice. Furthermore, guided by an external magnetic field and the folic acid (FA) that target tumors via folate receptor-mediated endocytosis on the cell surface, the vectors demonstrate a 30-40-fold increase in cell uptake. Moreover, this synergistic tumor-targeted approach can enhance a 10-fold increase in in vivo transfection efficacy by promoting the delivery of LPPs to cancer cells and facilitating the endosomal escape of gene molecules. The new insights and capabilities represent a major step in nanovector engineering for safe and efficient gene delivery. ? 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

An appropriate guiding vane with high-performance and low-noise feature can be achieved after several design iterations. To manufacture the mock-up for experimental verification, the designed fan is expressed in the CAD/CAM format for the rapid-prototype technique. Moreover, a set of relations correlating the performance and noise of this fan prototype are executed with the aids of AMCA test chamber and semi-anechoic chamber, respectively.

The targeting ability of these Trastuzumab-conjugated DENCs was demonstrated with confocal images, which revealed a significantly elevated cellular uptake in HER-2 overexpressing SkBr3 cells. More importantly, an intravenous injection of this co-delivery system followed by magnetic targeting (MT) chemotherapy suppressed cancer growth in vivo more efficiently than the delivery of either PTX or Dox alone.

A Q-switched pulsed neodymium-doped yttrium ortho-vanadate (Nd:YVO4) laser directed in-situ microfabrication technique for cell patterning is presented. A platform is designed uniquely to achieve laser ablation. The platform is comprised of thin gold coating over a glass surface that functions as a thermal transducer and is over-layered by a cell repellant polymer layer. Micropatterns are engraved on the platform, subsequently exposing specific cell adhesive micro-domains by ablating the gold-polymer coating photothermally. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is applicable under culture conditions, viable toward cells, and has a higher engraving speed. Possible uses in arraying isolated single cells on the platform are also shown. Additionally, based on those micro-patterns, dynamic cellular morphological changes and migrational speed in response to geometrical barriers are studied to demonstrate the potential applications of the proposed approach. Our results further demonstrate that cells in narrower geometry had elongated shapes and higher migrational speed than those in wider geometry. Importantly, the proposed approach will provide a valuable reference for efforts to study single cell dynamics and cellular migration related processes for areas such as cell division, wound healing, and cancer invasion. ? 2014 The Authors.",Cell array; Cellular migration; Cytophobic polymer; Laser ablation; Thermal transducer,Biological experiments; Cell array; Cellular micropattering; Cellular migration; Culture conditions; Micro-fabrication techniques; Morphological changes; Photo patterning; Cell proliferation; Cytology; Geometry; Gold; Gold coatings; Laser ablation; Neodymium; Polymers; Pulsed lasers; Q switching; Transducers; Yttrium; Cells; neodymium; vanadic acid; yttrium; article; cell motion; culture technique; equipment; HeLa cell; human; laser; methodology; optics; physiology; culture technique; devices; HeLa cell line; optics; procedures; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Movement; HeLa Cells; Humans; Lasers; Neodymium; Optics and Photonics; Vanadates; Yttrium; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Movement; HeLa Cells; Humans; Lasers; Neodymium; Optics and Photonics; Vanadates; Yttrium,2-s2.0-84887247344

Recently, evidence of low prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation in individuals with schizophrenia has also been found during verbal fluency tests (VFT) and other cognitive tests with several neuroimaging methods. The purpose of this study is to assess the hemodynamic changes of the PFC and discriminant analysis between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls during VFT task by utilizing functional optical topography. A total of 99 subjects including 53 schizophrenic patients and 46 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were studied. The results showed that the healthy group had larger activation in the right and left PFC than in the middle PFC. Besides, the schizophrenic group showed weaker task performance and lower activation in the whole PFC than the healthy group. The result of the discriminant analysis showed a significant difference with P value <0.001 in six channels (CH 23, 29, 31, 40, 42, 52) between the schizophrenic and healthy groups. Finally, 68.69% and 71.72% of subjects are correctly classified as being schizophrenic or healthy with all 52 channels and six significantly different channels, respectively.

To monitor legumain activity in tumors, we developed a new MRI contrast agent ([Gd-NBCB-TTDA-Leg(L)]) and a NIR fluorescence probe (CyTE777-Leg(L)-CyTE807). The MRI contrast agent was prepared by introduction of cyclobutyl and benzyl group residues to TTDA (3,6,10-tri(carboxymethyl)-3,6,10-triaza-dodecanedioic acid), followed by the attachment of a legumain-specific substrate peptide (Leg(L)). The NIR fluorescence probe was designed by conjugating two NIR fluorochromes (CyTE777 and CyTE807) with Leg(L). Peptide cleavage of the MRI contrast agent by legumain can increase its hydrophobicity and promote rotational correlation time (τR). Peptide cleavage of the NIR probes by the legumain relieves the self quench of the probe. Peptide cleavage of the MRI contrast agent and the NIR fluorescence probe by legumain were confirmed by T1 relaxometric studies and by fluorescence studies, respectively. Invivo MR images showed that [Gd-NBCB-TTDA-Leg(L)] attained 55.3 fold (254.2% versus 4.6%, at 2.0h post-injection) higher imaging enhancement, as compared with control contrast agent bearing a noncleaveable peptide ([Gd-NBCB-TTDA-Leg(D)], in the CT-26 (legumain+) tumors. Similarly, optical imaging probe CyTE777-Leg(L)-CyTE807 attained 15.2 fold (3.34×109 photons/min versus 0.22×109 photons/min, at 24.0h post-injection) higher imaging enhancement in the CT-26 (legumain+) tumors, compared to a NIR control probe (CyTE777-Leg(D)-CyTE807).
